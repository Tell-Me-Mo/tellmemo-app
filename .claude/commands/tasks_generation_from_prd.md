Analyze PROACTIVE_MEETING_ASSISTANCE_HLD.md file completely and create a comprehensive TASKS-MEETINGS-ASSISTNACE.md file that breaks down the requirements into actionable development tasks.
Tasks should not be too small. Since tasks will be developed by Claude Code, for small tasks, it will take more time to each time investigate the codebase.

PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS:
1. Scan the entire codebase to understand:
   - Existing features and functionality
   - Current project structure
   - Implemented components
   - Database schema if it exists
   - API endpoints already created
   - UI components already built

Structure the TASKS-MEETINGS-ASSISTNACE.md file as follows:

1. Use markdown format with clear hierarchy
2. Group tasks by major features or components from the PRD
3. For each task include:
   - Clear task title
   - Brief description (1-2 sentences)
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Estimated complexity (Simple/Medium/Complex)
   - Dependencies (if any)
   - Priority level (P0/P1/P2)

Format each task like this:

## [Feature/Component Name]

### Task: [Task Title]
**Description:** [Brief description of what needs to be done]
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
**Complexity:** [Simple/Medium/Complex]
**Dependencies:** [List any dependent tasks]
**Priority:** [P0/P1/P2]

Ensure tasks are:
- Clearly defined with measurable outcomes
- Ordered logically based on dependencies
- Include both functional and non-functional requirements

Add a summary section at the top with:
- Total number of tasks
- Breakdown by priority
- Breakdown by complexity
- Critical path highlights

Read the PROACTIVE_MEETING_ASSISTANCE_HLD.md file and use ultrathink to generate the complete TASKS-MEETINGS-ASSISTNACE.md file based on these guidelines.
