## [Unreleased]

### [2025-10-26]
#### Added
- **Task 2.3 - Implement Stream Router**: Created message routing service that dispatches NDJSON objects from GPT-5-mini to appropriate handlers
  - Implementation: Python service class with handler registration pattern and bidirectional state tracking
  - Core Components:
    - `StreamRouter` class: Main routing engine with handler callback registration
    - Object validation: Validates type, required fields, and UUID format for all NDJSON objects
    - ID validation: Validates GPT-generated UUIDs (q_{uuid}, a_{uuid}) with graceful fallback
    - State tracking: Bidirectional mappings (question_ids, action_ids, id_to_session) for session management
    - Metric collection: Tracks latency, throughput, error rates per session
  - Routing Logic:
    - Supported types: question, action, action_update, answer
    - Handler registration: Async callbacks for each object type (QuestionHandler, ActionHandler, AnswerHandler)
    - Type-based routing: Dispatches objects to registered handlers based on 'type' field
    - State management: Tracks active question/action IDs, maps GPT IDs to session_id
  - Error Handling:
    - Malformed objects: Graceful degradation (logs warning, increments counter, continues processing)
    - UUID validation: Logs warning for invalid UUIDs but allows processing
    - Handler exceptions: Catches and wraps as StreamRouterException with context
    - Missing handlers: Logs warning but doesn't fail (allows partial system operation)
  - ID Validation Strategy:
    - GPT system prompt instructs format: q_{uuid} for questions, a_{uuid} for actions
    - Router validates UUID part after prefix using uuid.UUID()
    - Invalid UUIDs logged as warnings but don't block routing
    - Backend can generate new UUIDs if needed (handlers decide)
  - Metrics Collection (RouterMetrics dataclass):
    - total_objects_processed: Total objects successfully routed
    - questions_routed, actions_routed, action_updates_routed, answers_routed: Per-type counters
    - malformed_objects, routing_errors: Error tracking
    - average_latency_ms: Per-object routing latency with automatic averaging
  - Factory Pattern:
    - `get_stream_router(session_id)`: Singleton factory for session-specific routers
    - `cleanup_stream_router(session_id)`: Session cleanup with state clearing
    - Session isolation: Each session has independent router instance
  - Testing: 30 comprehensive unit tests (100% pass rate)
    - Initialization and factory pattern (2 tests)
    - Handler registration (3 tests)
    - Object validation: valid/invalid cases for all types (8 tests)
    - ID validation: valid UUID formats, invalid formats, edge cases (4 tests)
    - Routing: all object types with handlers (5 tests)
    - Error handling: malformed objects, handler exceptions (2 tests)
    - Metrics: collection and calculation (2 tests)
    - State management and cleanup (2 tests)
    - Integration: full conversation flow with multiple objects (2 tests)

    - `/backend/services/intelligence/stream_router.py` (created - 400 lines)
    - `/backend/tests/unit/test_stream_router.py` (created - 30 tests, 525 lines)

- **Task 2.2 - Implement GPT Streaming Interface**: Created OpenAI GPT-5-mini streaming service with NDJSON parsing and comprehensive error handling
  - Implementation: Dedicated streaming client with async generator pattern for real-time intelligence detection
  - Core Components:
    - `GPT5StreamingClient` class: Main streaming client with configurable model, temperature, max_tokens, timeout
    - `stream_intelligence()` async generator: Streams JSON objects from GPT-5-mini in real-time
    - NDJSON parser: Buffers chunks and extracts complete JSON objects separated by newlines
    - Token tracking: Monitors token usage with `stream_options={"include_usage": True}`
  - OpenAI API Integration:
    - Endpoint: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
    - Model: `gpt-5-mini` with temperature=0.3 for consistent structured output
    - Streaming enabled: `stream=True` for real-time responses
    - Max tokens: 1000 (sufficient for question/action/answer detection)
    - Timeout: 30 seconds with configurable override
  - Error Handling & Recovery:
    - Rate limit detection (429 errors) with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
    - Timeout handling (504 errors) with up to 3 retry attempts
    - Overload detection (529/503 errors) with immediate failure
    - Stream interruption recovery with idempotent retry
    - Malformed JSON handling (logs warning and skips invalid lines)
  - Context Management:
    - Formats transcript buffer (~1200 tokens) with recent questions/actions (~500 tokens)
    - System prompt (~300 tokens) for total request size ~2000 tokens
    - Includes session_id, speaker attribution, timestamps in user message
  - Comprehensive Logging:
    - Request logging: model, temperature, max_tokens, prompt preview (first 100 chars)
    - Response logging: duration, object count, token usage
    - Error logging: rate limits, timeouts, malformed JSON with context
  - MultiLLMClient Extension:
    - Added `create_message_stream()` abstract method to `BaseProviderClient`
    - Implemented in `OpenAIProviderClient` (delegates to GPT5StreamingClient)
    - Stub implementations in `ClaudeProviderClient` and `DeepSeekProviderClient` (raises NotImplementedError)
    - Added `create_message_stream()` method to `MultiProviderLLMClient` for easy provider-agnostic streaming
  - Testing: 9 comprehensive unit tests (2 skipped for integration testing)
    - Successful NDJSON streaming with multiple objects
    - Malformed JSON handling (skips invalid lines)
    - Timeout handling with retry attempts
    - Overload error detection
    - Empty stream handling
