- **Task 8.2 - Integration Tests for Four-Tier Answer Discovery**: Created comprehensive end-to-end integration tests for the complete answer discovery system
  - Implementation: 11 integration tests covering all four answer discovery tiers (RAG → Meeting Context → Live Monitoring → GPT-Generated)
  - Test Coverage:
    - **TestFullAnswerDiscoveryFlow** (4 tests): Tests each tier independently with proper mocking
      - `test_tier1_rag_finds_answer_immediately`: RAG search returns documents from vector store
      - `test_tier2_meeting_context_finds_answer`: Earlier meeting discussion provides answer
      - `test_tier3_live_monitoring_detects_answer`: Answer appears in 15s monitoring window
      - `test_tier4_gpt_generates_fallback_answer`: GPT-5-mini generates answer when all tiers fail
    - **TestTimeoutHandling** (3 tests): Validates timeout enforcement for each tier
      - RAG timeout: 2 seconds
      - Meeting context timeout: 1.5 seconds
      - Live monitoring timeout: 15 seconds (reduced to 2s for faster testing)
    - **TestGracefulDegradation** (2 tests): System continues when tiers fail gracefully

    - `mock_broadcast_callback`: Captures WebSocket messages for assertions
  - **Bugs Discovered and Fixed During Testing:**
    1. SessionLocal import errors → Fixed by using `get_db_context()` (4 locations in question_handler.py)
    2. Migration column mismatch: `metadata` → `insight_metadata` in migration file
    3. Missing "source" field in RAG_RESULT_PROGRESSIVE WebSocket broadcast
    4. Test strategy updated to use database-generated UUIDs (more reliable than GPT IDs)
  - Files Created:
    - `/backend/tests/integration/test_answer_discovery.py` (1000+ lines with comprehensive test scenarios)
  - Files Modified:
    - `/backend/services/intelligence/question_handler.py` (lines 302, 397, 487, 599: SessionLocal → get_db_context; line 280: added source field)

  - Test Database: Created `pm_master_test` database, schema auto-managed by conftest fixtures
  - Status: Integration tests successfully created, discovered and fixed 4 critical bugs in implementation

#### Fixed
- **Fixed Circular Import in StreamingOrchestrator**: Resolved circular dependency between `streaming_orchestrator.py` and `websocket_live_insights.py`
  - Implementation: Used lazy import pattern with `_get_insights_manager()` helper function
  - Issue: `streaming_orchestrator` was importing `insights_manager` at module level, while `websocket_live_insights` imported `streaming_orchestrator`, creating circular dependency
  - Solution: Moved import inside function call, executed only when needed
  - Files Modified:
    - `/backend/services/intelligence/streaming_orchestrator.py:43-55` (added lazy import function)
    - `/backend/services/intelligence/streaming_orchestrator.py:171` (replaced direct call)
    - `/backend/services/intelligence/streaming_orchestrator.py:638` (replaced direct call)

- **Fixed Logger Import in GPTAnswerGenerator**: Corrected import path for logger module
  - Implementation: Changed `from core.logging import get_logger` to `from utils.logger import get_logger`
  - Issue: GPTAnswerGenerator was using incorrect import path causing ModuleNotFoundError
  - Files Modified:
    - `/backend/services/intelligence/gpt_answer_generator.py:18`

    - Owner assignment (30%): Any non-null owner value
    - Deadline specified (30%): Any non-null deadline value
    - Returns float from 0.0 (description only) to 1.0 (all fields)
  - Action Merging Logic:
    - Searches last 10 actions in session for similar descriptions
    - Calculates keyword overlap using set operations
    - Merges if similarity >60% (common_words / total_words)
    - Updates existing action with missing fields (owner, deadline)
    - Tracks merged action IDs in metadata.related_ids
    - Prevents duplicate action creation for same task
  - Segment Alerting:
    - Triggered at natural meeting breakpoints (via SegmentDetector)
    - Filters for high-confidence (>0.8) incomplete actions (<1.0)
    - Identifies missing fields (owner, deadline) for each action
    - Broadcasts ACTION_ALERT events with missing field details
    - Prompts user to complete action information before segment ends
  - Database Integration:
    - Uses LiveMeetingInsight model with InsightType.ACTION
    - Stores action in `content` field
    - Stores metadata: gpt_id, owner, deadline, completeness_score, confidence, related_ids, update_history
    - Status lifecycle: TRACKED → COMPLETE (when completeness = 1.0)
    - JSONB metadata allows flexible schema for additional fields
  - Resource Management:
    - Tracks active actions per session in memory for fast merging
    - Session cleanup removes in-memory state on meeting end
    - Metrics tracking: actions_routed, action_updates_routed

    - **Tier 4 (GPT-Generated)**: Placeholder for GPT answer generation service (Task 3.4)
      - Triggered only when Tiers 1-3 fail to find answers
      - Marks questions as UNANSWERED if not implemented
  - Parallel Search Orchestration:
    - Executes Tier 1 and Tier 2 in parallel using `asyncio.gather()`

- **Task 2.3 - Implement Stream Router**: Created message routing service that dispatches NDJSON objects from GPT-5-mini to appropriate handlers
  - Implementation: Python service class with handler registration pattern and bidirectional state tracking
  - Core Components:
    - `StreamRouter` class: Main routing engine with handler callback registration
    - Object validation: Validates type, required fields, and UUID format for all NDJSON objects

    - State tracking: Bidirectional mappings (question_ids, action_ids, id_to_session) for session management
    - Metric collection: Tracks latency, throughput, error rates per session
  - Routing Logic:
    - Supported types: question, action, action_update, answer
    - Handler registration: Async callbacks for each object type (QuestionHandler, ActionHandler, AnswerHandler)
    - Type-based routing: Dispatches objects to registered handlers based on 'type' field
    - State management: Tracks active question/action IDs, maps GPT IDs to session_id
  - Error Handling:
    - Malformed objects: Graceful degradation (logs warning, increments counter, continues processing)

    - Handler exceptions: Catches and wraps as StreamRouterException with context
    - Missing handlers: Logs warning but doesn't fail (allows partial system operation)
  - ID Validation Strategy:
    - GPT system prompt instructs format: q_{uuid} for questions, a_{uuid} for actions
    - Router validates UUID part after prefix using uuid.UUID()
    - Invalid UUIDs logged as warnings but don't block routing
    - Backend can generate new UUIDs if needed (handlers decide)
  - Metrics Collection (RouterMetrics dataclass):
    - total_objects_processed: Total objects successfully routed
    - questions_routed, actions_routed, action_updates_routed, answers_routed: Per-type counters
    - malformed_objects, routing_errors: Error tracking
    - average_latency_ms: Per-object routing latency with automatic averaging
  - Factory Pattern:
    - `get_stream_router(session_id)`: Singleton factory for session-specific routers
    - `cleanup_stream_router(session_id)`: Session cleanup with state clearing
    - Session isolation: Each session has independent router instance
  - Testing: 30 comprehensive unit tests (100% pass rate)
    - Initialization and factory pattern (2 tests)
    - Handler registration (3 tests)
    - Object validation: valid/invalid cases for all types (8 tests)

    - Overload detection (529/503 errors) with immediate failure
    - Stream interruption recovery with idempotent retry
    - Malformed JSON handling (logs warning and skips invalid lines)
  - Context Management:
    - Formats transcript buffer (~1200 tokens) with recent questions/actions (~500 tokens)
    - System prompt (~300 tokens) for total request size ~2000 tokens
    - Includes session_id, speaker attribution, timestamps in user message
  - Comprehensive Logging:
    - Request logging: model, temperature, max_tokens, prompt preview (first 100 chars)
    - Response logging: duration, object count, token usage
