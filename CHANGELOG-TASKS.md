## [Unreleased]

### [2025-10-26]
#### Added
- **Task 2.6 - Implement Answer Handler Service**: Created intelligent answer detection and question resolution service
  - Implementation: Python service class with confidence-based matching and lifecycle integration
  - Core Components:
    - `AnswerHandler` class: Main handler for answer event processing and question resolution
    - Confidence threshold enforcement: Configurable minimum confidence (default 0.85) to mark questions as answered
    - Question lifecycle management: Updates status from SEARCHING/MONITORING to ANSWERED
    - Database integration: Stores answers in `live_meeting_insights` table with LIVE_CONVERSATION source
    - WebSocket broadcasting: Real-time ANSWER_DETECTED events to connected clients
  - Event Processing:
    - **Answer Events**: Processes answer detection from GPT stream
      - Validates required fields: question_id, answer_text
      - Checks confidence threshold before processing (>0.85 default)
      - Finds matching question by gpt_id in database
      - Updates question status to ANSWERED
      - Sets answer_source to LIVE_CONVERSATION
      - Adds tier result with answer details, speaker, timestamp
      - Broadcasts ANSWER_DETECTED event with full answer data
    - **Monitoring Cancellation**: Integrates with QuestionHandler to cancel Tier 3 monitoring
      - Calls `question_handler.cancel_monitoring()` when answer found
      - Prevents unnecessary 15-second monitoring window
      - Gracefully handles cases where QuestionHandler not registered
    - **Confidence Filtering**: Answers with confidence <0.85 are logged but not processed
      - Tracks low_confidence_answers metric for monitoring
      - Allows system to wait for higher-quality answers
  - Database Pattern:
    - Uses `get_db_context()` for async session management
    - Queries by session_id and gpt_id in metadata
    - Updates status using `LiveMeetingInsight.update_status()`
    - Sets answer source using `set_answer_source()` method
    - Adds tier result using `add_tier_result()` method
    - Automatic commit handling via context manager
  - WebSocket Event Format:
    ```json
    {
      "type": "ANSWER_DETECTED",
      "question_id": "uuid",
      "answer": "The answer text",
      "speaker": "Speaker B",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "source": "live_conversation",
      "timestamp": "2025-10-26T10:30:00Z"
    }
    ```
  - Error Handling:
    - Missing required fields: Logs warning and skips processing
    - Low confidence: Logs and increments metric, doesn't resolve question
    - Question not found: Logs warning and returns None
    - Database errors: Exception logging with session context
    - Monitoring cancellation failures: Logged but don't block answer processing
    - WebSocket broadcast failures: Logged but don't block answer processing
  - Metrics Tracking:
    - `answers_processed`: Total answer events received
    - `questions_resolved`: Questions successfully marked as answered
    - `low_confidence_answers`: Answers filtered due to low confidence
  - Testing: 21 comprehensive unit tests (100% coverage)
    - Initialization and configuration (3 tests)

    - Action state management: Tracks active actions per session with metadata (owner, deadline, completeness)
    - Completeness scoring: 3-tier scoring system (40% description, 30% owner, 30% deadline)
    - Action merging: Semantic similarity detection to merge related actions (>60% keyword overlap)
    - Segment alerts: Generates alerts at meeting boundaries for high-confidence incomplete actions
    - WebSocket broadcasting: Real-time ACTION_TRACKED, ACTION_UPDATED, and ACTION_ALERT events
  - Event Processing:
    - **Action Events**: Processes new action detection from GPT stream with confidence filtering (>0.6)
      - Validates confidence threshold before tracking
      - Calculates initial completeness score
      - Checks for similar existing actions via keyword matching
      - Stores in `live_meeting_insights` table with InsightType.ACTION
      - Broadcasts ACTION_TRACKED event with full action details

      - Recalculates completeness score
      - Tracks update history with timestamps and changes
      - Updates status to COMPLETE if fully specified
      - Broadcasts ACTION_UPDATED event with change diff
  - Completeness Scoring Algorithm:
    - Description clarity (40%): Minimum 10 characters required
    - Owner assignment (30%): Any non-null owner value
    - Deadline specified (30%): Any non-null deadline value
    - Returns float from 0.0 (description only) to 1.0 (all fields)
  - Action Merging Logic:
    - Searches last 10 actions in session for similar descriptions
    - Calculates keyword overlap using set operations
    - Merges if similarity >60% (common_words / total_words)
    - Updates existing action with missing fields (owner, deadline)
    - Tracks merged action IDs in metadata.related_ids
    - Prevents duplicate action creation for same task
  - Segment Alerting:
    - Triggered at natural meeting breakpoints (via SegmentDetector)
    - Filters for high-confidence (>0.8) incomplete actions (<1.0)
    - Identifies missing fields (owner, deadline) for each action
    - Broadcasts ACTION_ALERT events with missing field details
    - Prompts user to complete action information before segment ends
  - Database Integration:
    - Uses LiveMeetingInsight model with InsightType.ACTION
    - Stores action in `content` field
    - Stores metadata: gpt_id, owner, deadline, completeness_score, confidence, related_ids, update_history
    - Status lifecycle: TRACKED â†’ COMPLETE (when completeness = 1.0)
    - JSONB metadata allows flexible schema for additional fields

    - GPT system prompt instructs format: q_{uuid} for questions, a_{uuid} for actions
    - Router validates UUID part after prefix using uuid.UUID()
    - Invalid UUIDs logged as warnings but don't block routing
    - Backend can generate new UUIDs if needed (handlers decide)
