# TellMeMo Task Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### [2025-10-26]
#### Added
- **Task 2.1 - Implement Transcription Buffer Manager**: Created rolling window buffer service for managing real-time transcription context
  - Implementation: Python service with Redis-based distributed storage and automatic time/count-based trimming
  - Service Features:
    - `TranscriptionSentence` dataclass: Structured sentence representation with timestamp, speaker, confidence, metadata
    - Rolling 60-second window with automatic trimming (configurable via `TRANSCRIPTION_BUFFER_WINDOW_SECONDS`)
    - Size-based limiting (max 100 sentences, configurable via `TRANSCRIPTION_BUFFER_MAX_SENTENCES`)
    - Redis Sorted Set (ZSET) for efficient time-based ordering and range queries
    - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable
    - TTL-based auto-cleanup (2 hours after session end)
  - Core Methods:
    - `add_sentence()`: Add sentence with automatic trimming and TTL management
    - `get_buffer()`: Retrieve sentences in chronological order with optional time window
    - `get_formatted_context()`: Generate GPT-ready formatted transcription (with/without timestamps and speakers)
    - `get_buffer_stats()`: Monitoring metrics (sentence count, time span, TTL, Redis status)
    - `clear_buffer()`: Manual buffer cleanup for session end
  - Redis Integration:
    - Password authentication support
    - Async connection pooling with lazy initialization
    - Sorted Set operations: ZADD, ZRANGE, ZREMRANGEBYSCORE, ZREMRANGEBYRANK, ZCARD
    - Key pattern: `transcription_buffer:{session_id}`
  - Configuration:
    - Added 3 settings to `/backend/config.py`: window_seconds (60), max_sentences (100), ttl_hours (2)
    - Environment variables: `TRANSCRIPTION_BUFFER_WINDOW_SECONDS`, `TRANSCRIPTION_BUFFER_MAX_SENTENCES`, `TRANSCRIPTION_BUFFER_TTL_HOURS`
  - Testing: 24 comprehensive unit tests covering all service methods, edge cases, and graceful degradation
  - Files:
    - `/backend/services/transcription/transcription_buffer_service.py` (created - 366 lines)
    - `/backend/config.py` (modified - added 3 buffer configuration fields)
    - `/backend/tests/unit/test_transcription_buffer_service.py` (created - 24 tests, 593 lines)
  - Status: Service ready for integration with GPT Streaming Interface (Task 2.2) and Meeting Context Search (Task 3.2)

### [2025-10-26]
#### Added
- **Task 1.2 - Create Live Insights SQLAlchemy Model**: Implemented Python ORM model for live meeting insights
  - Implementation: Created comprehensive model with three enums (InsightType, InsightStatus, AnswerSource)
  - Model Features:
    - Three enum classes for type safety: InsightType (QUESTION, ACTION, ANSWER), InsightStatus (7 states), AnswerSource (6 sources for four-tier discovery)
    - 13 columns: id, session_id, recording_id, project_id, organization_id, insight_type, detected_at, speaker, content, status, answer_source, metadata, created_at, updated_at
    - Relationships: bidirectional with Recording, Project, and Organization models (with CASCADE delete)
    - JSONB metadata field for flexible storage of tier_results, completeness_score, confidence
  - Helper Methods:
    - `update_status()`: Updates insight status and timestamp
    - `add_tier_result()`: Adds tier-specific results (RAG, meeting_context, live_conversation, gpt_generated)
    - `calculate_completeness()`: Calculates action completeness score (0.4 description, 0.3 owner, 0.3 deadline)
    - `set_answer_source()`: Sets answer source with confidence score
    - `to_dict()`: Converts model to dictionary for API responses
  - Testing: 23 comprehensive unit tests covering all enums, methods, and edge cases
  - Files:
    - `/backend/models/live_insight.py` (created - 213 lines)
    - `/backend/models/recording.py` (modified - added live_insights relationship)
    - `/backend/models/project.py` (modified - added live_insights relationship)
    - `/backend/models/organization.py` (modified - added live_insights relationship)
    - `/backend/tests/unit/test_live_insight_model.py` (created - 23 tests, 420 lines)
  - Status: Model ready for use in streaming intelligence handlers

- **Task 1.1 - Create Live Meeting Insights Table**: Implemented database schema for storing real-time meeting intelligence
  - Implementation: Created Alembic migration with live_meeting_insights table including 14 columns (id, session_id, recording_id, project_id, organization_id, insight_type, detected_at, speaker, content, status, answer_source, metadata, created_at, updated_at)
  - Database Features:
    - Foreign key constraints with CASCADE delete for projects and organizations
    - 9 total indexes: 7 single-column indexes (session_id, recording_id, project_id, organization_id, insight_type, detected_at, speaker) + 2 composite indexes (project_id+created_at, session_id+detected_at)
    - JSONB metadata column for flexible tier_results, completeness_score, confidence storage
    - PostgreSQL UUID primary key with timezone-aware DateTime columns
  - Migration tested: Both upgrade and downgrade operations verified successfully
  - Files:
    - `/backend/alembic/versions/f11cd7beb6f5_add_live_meeting_insights_table.py` (created)
  - Status: Migration applied to database, table created and verified
