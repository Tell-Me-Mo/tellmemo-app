- **Task 2.5 - Implement Action Handler Service**: Created comprehensive action tracking service with state management, accumulation, and alerting
  - Implementation: Python service class with completeness scoring, action merging, and segment-based alerting
  - Core Components:
    - `ActionHandler` class: Main handler for action detection, tracking, and lifecycle management
    - Action state management: Tracks active actions per session with metadata (owner, deadline, completeness)
    - Completeness scoring: 3-tier scoring system (40% description, 30% owner, 30% deadline)
    - Action merging: Semantic similarity detection to merge related actions (>60% keyword overlap)
    - Segment alerts: Generates alerts at meeting boundaries for high-confidence incomplete actions
    - WebSocket broadcasting: Real-time ACTION_TRACKED, ACTION_UPDATED, and ACTION_ALERT events
  - Event Processing:
    - **Action Events**: Processes new action detection from GPT stream with confidence filtering (>0.6)
      - Validates confidence threshold before tracking
      - Calculates initial completeness score
      - Checks for similar existing actions via keyword matching
      - Stores in `live_meeting_insights` table with InsightType.ACTION
      - Broadcasts ACTION_TRACKED event with full action details
    - **Action Update Events**: Enriches existing actions with new information (owner, deadline)
      - Finds action by gpt_id in database
      - Updates metadata with new fields
      - Recalculates completeness score
      - Tracks update history with timestamps and changes
      - Updates status to COMPLETE if fully specified
      - Broadcasts ACTION_UPDATED event with change diff
  - Completeness Scoring Algorithm:
    - Description clarity (40%): Minimum 10 characters required
    - Owner assignment (30%): Any non-null owner value
    - Deadline specified (30%): Any non-null deadline value
    - Returns float from 0.0 (description only) to 1.0 (all fields)
  - Action Merging Logic:
    - Searches last 10 actions in session for similar descriptions
    - Calculates keyword overlap using set operations
    - Merges if similarity >60% (common_words / total_words)
    - Updates existing action with missing fields (owner, deadline)
    - Tracks merged action IDs in metadata.related_ids
    - Prevents duplicate action creation for same task
  - Segment Alerting:
    - Triggered at natural meeting breakpoints (via SegmentDetector)
    - Filters for high-confidence (>0.8) incomplete actions (<1.0)
    - Identifies missing fields (owner, deadline) for each action
    - Broadcasts ACTION_ALERT events with missing field details
    - Prompts user to complete action information before segment ends
  - Database Integration:
    - Uses LiveMeetingInsight model with InsightType.ACTION
    - Stores action in `content` field
    - Stores metadata: gpt_id, owner, deadline, completeness_score, confidence, related_ids, update_history
    - Status lifecycle: TRACKED → COMPLETE (when completeness = 1.0)
    - JSONB metadata allows flexible schema for additional fields
  - Resource Management:
    - Tracks active actions per session in memory for fast merging
    - Session cleanup removes in-memory state on meeting end
    - Metrics tracking: actions_routed, action_updates_routed

    - GPT system prompt instructs format: q_{uuid} for questions, a_{uuid} for actions
    - Router validates UUID part after prefix using uuid.UUID()
    - Invalid UUIDs logged as warnings but don't block routing
    - Backend can generate new UUIDs if needed (handlers decide)
