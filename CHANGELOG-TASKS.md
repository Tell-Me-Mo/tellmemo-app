## [Unreleased]

### [2025-10-26]
#### Added
- **Task 2.2 - Implement GPT Streaming Interface**: Created OpenAI GPT-5-mini streaming service with NDJSON parsing and comprehensive error handling
  - Implementation: Dedicated streaming client with async generator pattern for real-time intelligence detection
  - Core Components:
    - `GPT5StreamingClient` class: Main streaming client with configurable model, temperature, max_tokens, timeout
    - `stream_intelligence()` async generator: Streams JSON objects from GPT-5-mini in real-time
    - NDJSON parser: Buffers chunks and extracts complete JSON objects separated by newlines
    - Token tracking: Monitors token usage with `stream_options={"include_usage": True}`
  - OpenAI API Integration:
    - Endpoint: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
    - Model: `gpt-5-mini` with temperature=0.3 for consistent structured output
    - Streaming enabled: `stream=True` for real-time responses
    - Max tokens: 1000 (sufficient for question/action/answer detection)
    - Timeout: 30 seconds with configurable override
  - Error Handling & Recovery:
    - Rate limit detection (429 errors) with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
    - Timeout handling (504 errors) with up to 3 retry attempts
    - Overload detection (529/503 errors) with immediate failure
    - Stream interruption recovery with idempotent retry
    - Malformed JSON handling (logs warning and skips invalid lines)
  - Context Management:
    - Formats transcript buffer (~1200 tokens) with recent questions/actions (~500 tokens)
    - System prompt (~300 tokens) for total request size ~2000 tokens
    - Includes session_id, speaker attribution, timestamps in user message
  - Comprehensive Logging:
    - Request logging: model, temperature, max_tokens, prompt preview (first 100 chars)
    - Response logging: duration, object count, token usage
    - Error logging: rate limits, timeouts, malformed JSON with context
  - MultiLLMClient Extension:
    - Added `create_message_stream()` abstract method to `BaseProviderClient`
    - Implemented in `OpenAIProviderClient` (delegates to GPT5StreamingClient)
    - Stub implementations in `ClaudeProviderClient` and `DeepSeekProviderClient` (raises NotImplementedError)
    - Added `create_message_stream()` method to `MultiProviderLLMClient` for easy provider-agnostic streaming
  - Testing: 9 comprehensive unit tests (2 skipped for integration testing)
    - Successful NDJSON streaming with multiple objects
    - Malformed JSON handling (skips invalid lines)
    - Timeout handling with retry attempts
    - Overload error detection
    - Empty stream handling
    - Context formatting with recent questions/actions
    - Factory function testing
    - Incomplete buffer at end of stream
    - Objects without 'type' field (skipped)
  - Files:
    - `/backend/services/llm/gpt5_streaming.py` (created - 309 lines)
    - `/backend/services/llm/multi_llm_client.py` (modified - added streaming support to all provider clients)
    - `/backend/tests/unit/test_gpt5_streaming.py` (created - 11 tests, 406 lines)
  - Status: GPT-5 streaming interface ready for integration with Stream Router (Task 2.3) and downstream handlers

- **Task 2.1 - Implement Transcription Buffer Manager**: Created rolling window buffer service for managing real-time transcription context
  - Implementation: Python service with Redis-based distributed storage and automatic time/count-based trimming
  - Service Features:
    - `TranscriptionSentence` dataclass: Structured sentence representation with timestamp, speaker, confidence, metadata
    - Rolling 60-second window with automatic trimming (configurable via `TRANSCRIPTION_BUFFER_WINDOW_SECONDS`)
    - Size-based limiting (max 100 sentences, configurable via `TRANSCRIPTION_BUFFER_MAX_SENTENCES`)
    - Redis Sorted Set (ZSET) for efficient time-based ordering and range queries
    - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable
    - TTL-based auto-cleanup (2 hours after session end)
  - Core Methods:
    - `add_sentence()`: Add sentence with automatic trimming and TTL management
    - `get_buffer()`: Retrieve sentences in chronological order with optional time window
    - `get_formatted_context()`: Generate GPT-ready formatted transcription (with/without timestamps and speakers)
    - `get_buffer_stats()`: Monitoring metrics (sentence count, time span, TTL, Redis status)
    - `clear_buffer()`: Manual buffer cleanup for session end
  - Redis Integration:
    - Password authentication support
    - Async connection pooling with lazy initialization
    - Sorted Set operations: ZADD, ZRANGE, ZREMRANGEBYSCORE, ZREMRANGEBYRANK, ZCARD
    - Key pattern: `transcription_buffer:{session_id}`
  - Configuration:
    - Added 3 settings to `/backend/config.py`: window_seconds (60), max_sentences (100), ttl_hours (2)
    - Environment variables: `TRANSCRIPTION_BUFFER_WINDOW_SECONDS`, `TRANSCRIPTION_BUFFER_MAX_SENTENCES`, `TRANSCRIPTION_BUFFER_TTL_HOURS`
  - Testing: 24 comprehensive unit tests covering all service methods, edge cases, and graceful degradation
  - Files:
    - `/backend/services/transcription/transcription_buffer_service.py` (created - 366 lines)
    - `/backend/config.py` (modified - added 3 buffer configuration fields)
    - `/backend/tests/unit/test_transcription_buffer_service.py` (created - 24 tests, 593 lines)
  - Status: Service ready for integration with GPT Streaming Interface (Task 2.2) and Meeting Context Search (Task 3.2)

### [2025-10-26]
#### Added
- **Task 1.2 - Create Live Insights SQLAlchemy Model**: Implemented Python ORM model for live meeting insights
  - Implementation: Created comprehensive model with three enums (InsightType, InsightStatus, AnswerSource)
  - Model Features:
    - Three enum classes for type safety: InsightType (QUESTION, ACTION, ANSWER), InsightStatus (7 states), AnswerSource (6 sources for four-tier discovery)
    - 13 columns: id, session_id, recording_id, project_id, organization_id, insight_type, detected_at, speaker, content, status, answer_source, metadata, created_at, updated_at
    - Relationships: bidirectional with Recording, Project, and Organization models (with CASCADE delete)
    - JSONB metadata field for flexible storage of tier_results, completeness_score, confidence
  - Helper Methods:
    - `update_status()`: Updates insight status and timestamp
    - `add_tier_result()`: Adds tier-specific results (RAG, meeting_context, live_conversation, gpt_generated)
    - `calculate_completeness()`: Calculates action completeness score (0.4 description, 0.3 owner, 0.3 deadline)
    - `set_answer_source()`: Sets answer source with confidence score
    - `to_dict()`: Converts model to dictionary for API responses
  - Testing: 23 comprehensive unit tests covering all enums, methods, and edge cases
  - Files:
    - `/backend/models/live_insight.py` (created - 213 lines)
    - `/backend/models/recording.py` (modified - added live_insights relationship)
    - `/backend/models/project.py` (modified - added live_insights relationship)
    - `/backend/models/organization.py` (modified - added live_insights relationship)
    - `/backend/tests/unit/test_live_insight_model.py` (created - 23 tests, 420 lines)
  - Status: Model ready for use in streaming intelligence handlers

- **Task 1.1 - Create Live Meeting Insights Table**: Implemented database schema for storing real-time meeting intelligence
  - Implementation: Created Alembic migration with live_meeting_insights table including 14 columns (id, session_id, recording_id, project_id, organization_id, insight_type, detected_at, speaker, content, status, answer_source, metadata, created_at, updated_at)
  - Database Features:
    - Foreign key constraints with CASCADE delete for projects and organizations
    - 9 total indexes: 7 single-column indexes (session_id, recording_id, project_id, organization_id, insight_type, detected_at, speaker) + 2 composite indexes (project_id+created_at, session_id+detected_at)
    - JSONB metadata column for flexible tier_results, completeness_score, confidence storage
    - PostgreSQL UUID primary key with timezone-aware DateTime columns
  - Migration tested: Both upgrade and downgrade operations verified successfully
  - Files:
    - `/backend/alembic/versions/f11cd7beb6f5_add_live_meeting_insights_table.py` (created)
  - Status: Migration applied to database, table created and verified
