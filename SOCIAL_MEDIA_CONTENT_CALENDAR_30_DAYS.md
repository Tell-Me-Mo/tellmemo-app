### Day 2: The Problem We're Solving

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
"Wait, what did we decide in that meeting last week?" 🤔

Sound familiar?

Teams lose an average of 31 hours per month searching for information discussed in meetings. That's nearly a full work week!

The problem isn't having meetings. It's what happens AFTER:
❌ Action items forgotten
❌ Decisions buried in Slack threads
❌ Context lost between meetings
❌ New team members can't catch up
❌ "Who's doing what?" confusion

This is exactly why we built TellMeMo.

Upload your meeting transcripts, ask questions in plain English, get instant answers with source citations. No more digging through notes or rewatching recordings.

What's the biggest meeting pain point for your team? Let me know in the comments 👇

2️⃣ Searches your org's knowledge base (2-sec timeout)
3️⃣ Checks if it was answered earlier in THIS meeting
4️⃣ Monitors the conversation for natural answers
5️⃣ Falls back to AI only when needed (with clear disclaimer)

All in real-time. All while you focus on the conversation.

This is what we call "Proactive Meeting Assistance" - and it's unlike anything else in the market.

Every answer shows its source:
📚 From Documents
💬 Earlier in Meeting
👂 Answered Live
🤖 AI Answer (rare fallback)

Zero guesswork. Complete transparency.

## Week 2: Deep Dives & Use Cases

### Day 8: Executive Decision-Making Use Case

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
"Why did we pivot the Q3 strategy?"

As an executive, you make dozens of high-stakes decisions every quarter.

6 months later, when someone questions the rationale, you need more than "I think it was about market conditions..."

**Real scenario with TellMeMo:**

An executive at a B2B SaaS company uses TellMeMo to maintain a searchable record of every strategic decision.

When their board asks: "What was the data behind the pricing model change?"

They don't scramble. They query:
→ "Pricing strategy discussion September 2024"

TellMeMo surfaces:
📊 Exact competitive analysis presented
💡 Team member objections and responses
📈 Revenue projections discussed
✅ Final decision rationale
👥 Who voted for/against

**All with timestamps to the original meetings.**

This isn't just meeting notes. This is **institutional memory at scale.**

Benefits:
✅ Defend decisions with data, not memory
✅ Onboard new executives 10x faster
✅ Track decision quality over time
✅ Build a knowledge moat

Your strategic decisions deserve better than scattered notes.

### Day 9: Remote Team Collaboration

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
Remote teams have a documentation problem. 📝

You've replaced hallway conversations with:
• Async Slack messages (buried in 47 channels)
• Zoom recordings (no one rewatches)
• Google Docs (which version is current?)
• "You had to be there" moments

**The hidden cost:** New team members take 3x longer to onboard. Context gets lost. Decisions get re-litigated.

TellMeMo turns this around:

**Scenario: New engineer joins your remote team**

Instead of: "Read these docs and ping me with questions"

They can ask:
→ "How did we decide on the current architecture?"
→ "What were the tradeoffs for using PostgreSQL vs MongoDB?"
→ "Why did we deprecate the old API?"

They get: Actual discussions, with context, from the people who decided.

**For distributed teams:**
✅ Timezone-friendly knowledge sharing
✅ Async onboarding that actually works
✅ Context preservation across team changes
✅ "Single source of truth" that's actually searchable

Your Notion docs are great. But conversations > documentation.

Capture both with TellMeMo: https://tellmemo.io

### Day 10: Four-Tier Answer Discovery Explained

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
Let's talk about how TellMeMo finds answers during live meetings. 🎯

Most AI meeting tools use a single approach: "Ask AI for an answer."

We use a **4-tier waterfall system** - and the difference is massive.

**TIER 1: Knowledge Base Search (2-second timeout)**
Searches all your uploaded docs/transcripts first.
Result: 📚 "From Documents: Q3_Budget_Plan.pdf (page 12)"

**TIER 2: Meeting Context Search (1.5-second timeout)**
Checks if the question was already answered EARLIER in this meeting.
Result: 💬 "Earlier in Meeting: [10:12] Sarah said 'We're deploying Friday'"

**TIER 3: Live Conversation Monitoring (15-second window)**
Listens to the ongoing conversation for natural answers.
Result: 👂 "Answered Live: [10:18] John - 'I'll handle API docs by next week'"

**TIER 4: AI-Generated Answer (3-second timeout, >70% confidence only)**
ONLY when all else fails, GPT provides an answer with a clear disclaimer.
Result: 🤖 "AI Answer ⚠️ Not from your documents or meeting - verify this"

**Why this matters:**

Traditional tools: AI answers everything → hallucination risk, no sources

TellMeMo: Real data first (Tiers 1-3), AI fallback last (Tier 4)

In production, **Tier 4 triggers <15% of the time.**

85%+ of answers come from YOUR actual data.

This is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) done right.

### Day 11: Automatic Action Item Tracking Deep Dive

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
"Who's doing what by when?"

The eternal post-meeting question. 🤔

Here's what usually happens:
1. Someone volunteers to "send action items after the meeting"
2. They get busy and send them 2 days later
3. Half the context is missing
4. Assignees don't see it in their task tracker
5. Items slip through the cracks

**TellMeMo's automatic action tracking works differently:**

During the meeting, as people speak naturally:

Sarah: "We need to update the API documentation"
→ ✅ Action tracked: "Update API documentation" (40% complete - missing owner/deadline)

John: "I can handle that"
→ ✅ Action updated: Owner = John (70% complete)

Sarah: "Can you have it done by next Friday?"
John: "Sure, I'll have it ready by Friday"
→ ✅ Action updated: Deadline = Friday, Nov 1st (100% complete ✓)

**The system gets smarter as the conversation flows.**

No manual entry. No follow-up emails. No context loss.

At meeting end:
• Fully specified actions (100% complete) are ready to export
• Incomplete actions are flagged for clarification
• Every action has timestamp references

**Then you can:**
• Export to Jira/Linear/Notion (coming soon)
• Assign to team members
• Track completion
• Link to original discussion

This is what AI should do: eliminate busywork, not create more.

### Day 14: Weekend Insight - Meeting ROI

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
Weekend thought: What's the ROI of your meetings? 💭

Let's do some math:

**Average tech company:**
• 10 people on the team
• $75k average salary
• 15 hours of meetings/week per person
• Cost per hour: ~$36

**Weekly meeting cost: $5,400**
**Annual meeting cost: $280,800**

Now ask yourself:
• How many decisions from those meetings do you remember 2 months later?
• How much time is spent RE-discussing things that were already decided?
• How many "Wait, why did we decide that?" moments happen?

If you could:
✅ Eliminate repeated discussions (save 20% of meeting time)
✅ Instant access to past decisions (save 5 hours/week of searching)
✅ Perfect onboarding for new hires (reduce ramp time by 30%)

**That's $70,000+/year in recovered time.**

TellMeMo's annual cost for that team? **~$252** (for 20 meetings/month).

**ROI: 277x** 📈

This isn't about having fewer meetings. It's about making the meetings you DO have actually compound value over time.

Your meetings are expensive. Make them worth it.

Try TellMeMo: https://tellmemo.io

What would you do with an extra 5 hours a week? 👇

## Week 3: Social Proof & Comparisons

### Day 15: vs. Traditional Note-Taking

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
"Just take better notes" they said. 📝

Here's what actually happens:

**Traditional meeting notes:**
• Sarah takes notes in Notion
• John uses Apple Notes
• Mike prefers Google Docs
• Lisa just listens (great for her, chaos for everyone else)

Result: Knowledge siloed in 3 different places that no one searches.

**AI transcription tools (Otter, Fireflies):**
• Generate wall-of-text transcripts
• Search gives you keywords, not context
• No semantic understanding
• Reading 45-min transcripts isn't saving time

**TellMeMo approach:**

Instead of asking: "Where did we talk about API rate limits?"

Ask: "What did we decide about API rate limiting and why?"

Get:
→ Exact decision from June 12 standup
→ Tradeoffs discussed (DDoS protection vs UX)
→ Who advocated for what approach
→ Final decision + rationale
→ Related discussions from architecture review

**It's not transcription. It's intelligence.**

Comparison:
❌ Notes: Incomplete, siloed, unsearchable
❌ Transcription: Complete, searchable, but overwhelming
✅ TellMeMo: Complete, searchable, AND synthesized into answers

Stop documenting meetings. Start understanding them.

### Day 16: Integration with Existing Tools

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
"Another tool to manage?" 😩

I hear you. Your tech stack is already bloated:

📹 Zoom for calls
📝 Notion for docs
🎯 Jira for tasks
💬 Slack for chat
📧 Email for... too many things
🔥 Fireflies for transcripts

**Good news: TellMeMo doesn't replace these. It connects them.**

**Current integrations:**
✅ Fireflies.ai - Auto-import transcripts
✅ Direct upload - Any meeting format (Zoom, Meet, Teams)
✅ API access - Build custom integrations

**Coming soon (based on your feedback):**
🔜 Slack - Get answers in your workspace
🔜 Jira/Linear - Auto-create tasks from action items
🔜 Notion - Export summaries directly
🔜 Calendar - Auto-attach summaries to events

**How it works:**

1. Have meeting in Zoom
2. Fireflies creates transcript (like you already do)
3. TellMeMo imports automatically
4. Now you can search/query across ALL meetings
5. Action items sync to Jira
6. Summaries post to Slack

**You keep using the tools you love.**
**TellMeMo adds the intelligence layer.**

Think of it as: Your tools capture data → TellMeMo makes it useful

This is how modern tech stacks should work: integrated, not isolated.

What integration would you want next? Vote below 👇
A) Slack
B) Jira/Linear

### Day 17: Self-Hosting for Enterprise

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
Enterprise security teams: This one's for you. 🔒

"We can't use cloud AI tools. Compliance won't allow it."

I've heard this from:
• Financial services (GDPR + SOC2)
• Healthcare (HIPAA)
• Government contractors (FedRAMP)
• Legal firms (attorney-client privilege)

**The problem:** SaaS AI tools = your sensitive data on vendor servers.

**The solution:** Self-hosted TellMeMo.

**What you get:**

✅ **Complete data sovereignty**
Your meeting data never leaves your infrastructure. Zero external API calls for embeddings (local model).

✅ **Air-gapped deployment**
Run in on-prem data centers or private VPCs. No internet required for core functionality.

✅ **Audit trails**
Full PostgreSQL logs. Every query, every access, every user action tracked.

✅ **Custom LLM endpoints**
Use Azure OpenAI (BAA-compliant), AWS Bedrock, or your own fine-tuned models.

✅ **SSO/SAML integration**
Plug into your existing identity provider (Okta, Azure AD, etc.)

✅ **Open source transparency**
Audit the entire codebase. No black boxes.

**Deployment options:**

1. **Docker Compose** - Single-server (perfect for teams <50)
2. **Kubernetes** - Scalable (100+ users, high availability)
3. **Managed private cloud** - We run it in YOUR infrastructure

**Compliance we support:**
• GDPR (EU data residency)
• HIPAA (healthcare)
• SOC2 Type II (enterprise SaaS)
• ISO 27001 (information security)

Your meeting intelligence doesn't have to be a security risk.

### Day 18: Founder Story - Why I Built This

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
Why I built TellMeMo: A founder story 🧵

3 years ago, I was a product manager at a fast-growing startup.

We went from 5 to 50 people in 8 months. Exciting, right?

**But knowledge hemorrhaged.**

New engineers asking: "Why did we choose this architecture?"
Sales team: "What did that customer say about pricing?"
Me in standups: "Wait, didn't we already discuss this?"

We had the data:
• 200+ Zoom recordings
• Fireflies transcripts
• Notion docs galore
• Endless Slack threads

But **information ≠ knowledge.**

**The breaking point:**

A VP asked: "What was the rationale for killing the mobile app project?"

I spent 3 hours searching:
• Dug through Notion
• Ctrl+F'd Slack for weeks
• Scrubbed Zoom recordings
• Asked 5 different people (all remembered it differently)

**I thought: This is insane.**

We have all the data. We have AI. Why am I doing manual archaeology?

So I built the tool I needed.

**18 months later:**
✅ 100% open source
✅ Real-time meeting intelligence
✅ Self-hostable
✅ <$1.05/hour operating cost
✅ Launched on iOS

**The mission:**
Every team deserves to learn from their own conversations without doing manual labor.

**What's next:**
Your feedback is building the roadmap. Keep it coming.

Wednesday: QBR with Beta Inc
→ Feature request for SSO
→ You Slack it to product (maybe)

Friday: Renewal call with Gamma LLC
→ Competitor mentioned (yikes)
→ You... remember to follow up? (maybe)

**3 months later:**

CFO: "Why is our churn up?"
You: "Let me check..." *frantically searches notes*

**With TellMeMo:**

CFO: "Why is our churn up?"

You query:
→ "What pain points did churned customers mention in the last 90 days?"

### Day 21: Weekend Roundup - Week 3

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
Week 3 of TellMeMo: What we learned 📚

This week we dove deep into:
✅ Use cases (CS teams, PMOs, remote teams)
✅ Security (self-hosting for enterprise)
✅ Integrations (Fireflies, Slack, Jira roadmap)
✅ iOS app launch (now live!)

**Top 3 insights from your feedback:**

**1. "How does this compare to [existing tool]?" **
→ We're not replacing transcription tools. We're the intelligence layer on top.

**2. "Our compliance team would never approve cloud AI"**
→ Self-host it. Open source = full audit trail.

**3. "I don't have time to learn another tool"**
→ It takes <5 minutes. Upload a transcript, ask a question, see the magic.

**This week's favorite user story:**

A VP of Eng used TellMeMo to onboard a new engineering lead. Instead of "read these 50 docs," he said:

"Ask TellMeMo:
• Why did we choose microservices?
• What were the database migration challenges?
• How did we decide on the deployment pipeline?"

New lead was productive in 2 days instead of 2 weeks.

**Coming next week:**
• Slack integration beta
• Jira task sync preview
• More enterprise features

**Thank you** to everyone trying, sharing, and providing feedback. You're building this with us. 🙏

## Week 4: Advanced Features & Community Building

### Day 22: Semantic Search Deep Dive

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
Let's talk about search. 🔍

**Keyword search (old way):**
You search: "API rate limiting"
Results: Every document with those exact words

**Problem:** You miss:
• "Request throttling" (same concept, different words)
• "429 errors" (related symptom)
• "DDoS protection" (related use case)

**Semantic search (TellMeMo's way):**

You search: "API rate limiting"

TellMeMo understands you're asking about:
→ Request throttling mechanisms
→ Rate limit implementations
→ DDoS protection strategies
→ API quota management
→ Backoff strategies

Results include meetings where you discussed:
✅ "How to prevent API abuse" (same intent)
✅ "Should we implement request quotas?" (related decision)
✅ "Customer complained about 429 errors" (related problem)

**How it works (technical):**

1. Your query → 768-dimensional vector (EmbeddingGemma model)
2. Search Qdrant vector database (organization-scoped)
3. Find semantically similar content (cosine similarity >0.75)
4. Claude synthesizes results into an answer
5. Return answer + source citations

**Benefits:**

✅ Find information even when you don't know exact keywords
✅ Discover related discussions you forgot about
✅ Cross-reference different conversations on the same topic
✅ No boolean operators or advanced search syntax needed

**Example:**

Instead of:
❌ "API AND (rate OR throttl* OR quota) AND (limit* OR restrict*)"

Just ask:
✅ "How do we prevent API abuse?"

The AI understands intent, not just keywords.

**This is why teams find information they forgot they had.**

Try semantic search: https://tellmemo.io

What information do you struggle to find in your org? 👇

#SemanticSearch #AI #VectorDatabase #TellMeMo #SearchTechnology #InformationRetrieval

**Twitter Post:**
```
Keyword search: Find exact words

Semantic search: Understand intent

Search: "API rate limiting"

TellMeMo finds:
✅ Request throttling
✅ 429 errors
✅ DDoS protection
✅ API quota management

Same concept, different words.

This is the difference.

### Day 23: Onboarding New Team Members

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
New hire onboarding is broken. Let's fix it. 👋

**Traditional onboarding:**

Week 1: "Here's our Wiki. Read these 73 documents."
Week 2: "Shadow some meetings to learn our culture."
Week 3: "Still ramping up? That's normal."
Week 4: "You'll be fully productive... eventually."

**Reality:**
• 42% of docs are outdated
• Wiki doesn't capture "why" decisions were made
• Meetings give you today's context, not historical
• Asking "dumb questions" feels uncomfortable

**New hire 3 months later:**
"Why did we deprecate the old API?"
Senior dev: "Oh, there was a meeting about that... let me find it..."

**TellMeMo onboarding:**

**Day 1:** New engineer joins

Give them access to TellMeMo + this list of questions to ask:

**Architecture:**
"Why did we choose microservices over monolith?"
→ Full discussion from architecture review (March 2024)
→ Tradeoffs debated
→ Final decision rationale
→ Who advocated for what

**Codebase:**
"What are the most common bugs in the payment system?"
→ 15 instances from bug triage meetings
→ Root cause discussions
→ Patterns identified

**Culture:**
"How does this team make technical decisions?"
→ Examples from 20+ meetings
→ Process documentation (formal)
→ Actual behavior (informal)

**Product:**
"Why did we prioritize feature X over Y?"
→ Product roadmap discussion
→ Customer feedback mentioned
→ Revenue impact analysis

**Day 3:** They're asking informed questions in standup.

**Week 2:** They're contributing to architecture discussions.

**The difference:**

❌ Traditional: "Read everything, absorb context by osmosis"
✅ TellMeMo: "Ask anything, get answers with full context"

**Benefits:**

⏱️ Reduce ramp time by 40%
📈 Increase new hire confidence
🧠 Preserve institutional knowledge
👥 Scale team knowledge without senior dev bottleneck
💰 ROI visible in weeks, not months

Your org has years of collective wisdom in meeting recordings.

Make it accessible.

### Day 24: Cost Breakdown Transparency 2.0

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
Let's get radical about pricing transparency. 💰

Most SaaS: "Starting at $X/user/month*"
*Fine print: Plus overages, seats, features, add-ons

**TellMeMo: Here's our actual cost calculator.**

**Your inputs:**
• Team size: 15 people
• Meetings/month: 40 (avg 30 min each)
• Content uploaded: 50 transcripts/month

**TellMeMo's costs:**

**Real-time meeting intelligence:**
• AssemblyAI transcription: $0.90/hour
• GPT-5-mini streaming: $0.15/hour
• Per meeting (30 min avg): $0.52
• 40 meetings/month: **$20.80/month**

**Content processing:**
• Embeddings: $0 (local model)
• RAG queries (estimate 100/month): ~$2
• Summaries (estimate 20/month): ~$5
• Total: **$7/month**

**Infrastructure (if self-hosting):**
• PostgreSQL: $0 (Docker)
• Qdrant: $0 (local) or $25/month (cloud)
• Redis: $0 (Docker)
• Total: **$0-25/month**

**Grand total: $27.80 - $52.80/month**

For 15 people.

**Compare to alternatives:**

• Otter Business: $20/user × 15 = **$300/month**
• Fireflies Business: $19/user × 15 = **$285/month**
• Grain Business: $19/user × 15 = **$285/month**

**TellMeMo savings: $232 - $257/month (83-90% reduction)**

**But here's the kicker:**

We're not just cheaper. We do MORE:
✅ Real-time Q&A during meetings (others don't)
✅ Semantic search across all content
✅ Portfolio management
✅ Self-hosting option
✅ Open source transparency

**Why can we be this cheap?**

1. Local embeddings (no OpenAI embedding costs)
2. Efficient models (Haiku, not Opus for everything)
3. No VC pressure to maximize revenue
4. Open source = community contributions
5. You can self-host = infrastructure flexibility

**Our philosophy:**

AI tools should be accessible, not extractive.

### Day 25: Privacy & Data Security

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
"Where does my data go?" 🔒

If you're not asking this about AI tools, you should be.

**Most AI meeting tools:**

Your conversation →
Vendor's cloud →
Third-party transcription API →
Third-party LLM API →
Who knows where else?

**Questions you should ask:**

1. Where is my data stored?
2. Who can access it?
3. Is it used for model training?
4. Can I delete it completely?
5. What happens if the company gets acquired?

**TellMeMo's answers:**

**1. Where is data stored?**
→ Your choice:
  • Cloud: US/EU data centers (configurable)
  • Self-hosted: Your infrastructure (full control)

**2. Who can access it?**
→ Only your organization members
→ Row-level security (RLS) in PostgreSQL
→ Organization-scoped vector collections
→ Zero cross-contamination

**3. Is it used for training?**
→ **Never.** Explicit opt-out with all AI providers.
→ Local embedding model = no external API calls
→ Your data is yours, period.

**4. Can I delete it?**
→ Full GDPR right-to-delete
→ Cascade deletion (projects → content → vectors)
→ Permanent erasure, not soft delete

**5. What if you get acquired?**
→ Open source = you can fork the code
→ Self-hosted = you control everything
→ Export all your data anytime (JSON/CSV)

**Our data handling principles:**

✅ **Minimal collection** - We only store what's needed
✅ **Encryption** - At rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
✅ **Access controls** - RBAC with audit trails
✅ **Transparency** - Open source = full auditability
✅ **User control** - Delete/export anytime

**Industry certifications** (self-hosted supports):
• GDPR compliance (EU data residency)
• HIPAA-ready architecture
• SOC 2 Type II controls
• ISO 27001 framework

**Why this matters:**

Your meetings contain:
• Strategic decisions
• Customer information
• Competitive intel
• Unreleased product plans

### Day 27: Technical Deep Dive - RAG Architecture

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
Let's get technical: How TellMeMo's RAG system actually works 🔧

For the engineers and AI enthusiasts:

**Problem:** Generic LLMs hallucinate. They confidently make up facts.

**Solution:** RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

**TellMeMo's RAG Pipeline:**

**STEP 1: Content Ingestion**
```
Meeting transcript uploaded
→ Validated (format, size, content)
→ Stored in PostgreSQL (metadata)
→ Queued for processing (Redis Queue, high priority)
```

**STEP 2: Chunking**
```
Full transcript → Text splitter
→ ~500-word chunks (overlap: 50 words)
→ Preserve context (speaker, timestamps)
→ Metadata attached (meeting_id, project_id, org_id)
```

**STEP 3: Embedding Generation**
```
Each chunk → EmbeddingGemma-300m (local)
→ 768-dimensional vector
→ Batch processing (efficiency)
→ Store in Qdrant (organization collection)
```

**STEP 4: Vector Storage**
```
Qdrant point structure:
{
  "id": "content_uuid_chunk_0",
  "vector": [768 floats],
  "payload": {
    "content": "chunk text",
    "metadata": {...},
    "project_id": "...",
    "organization_id": "..."
  }
}
```

**STEP 5: Query Processing**
```
User asks: "What risks were identified?"
→ Query → EmbeddingGemma → 768-dim vector
→ Qdrant semantic search (org + project filtered)
→ Cosine similarity >0.75
→ Top 10 chunks retrieved
```

**STEP 6: Context Assembly**
```
Retrieved chunks →
Sort by relevance →
Deduplicate by source →
Construct prompt:
  "Context: [chunks]
   Question: [user query]
   Instructions: Answer using only the context..."
```

**STEP 7: LLM Generation**
```
Prompt → Claude 3.5 Haiku
→ Streaming response
→ Extract source citations
→ Format markdown
→ Return to user
```

**STEP 8: Fallback Handling**
```
Claude overloaded (529 error) →
Circuit breaker pattern →
→ Automatic OpenAI GPT-4o fallback
→ Zero user disruption
→ Langfuse tracks both providers
```

**Key Technical Decisions:**

**1. Why local embeddings (EmbeddingGemma)?**
✅ Zero API costs
✅ Fast inference (CPU-optimized)
✅ Privacy (no external calls)
✅ Sufficient quality (768-dim)

**2. Why Qdrant over Pinecone/Weaviate?**
✅ Self-hostable
✅ Excellent filtering (org isolation)
✅ Fast (HNSW index)
✅ Active development

**3. Why Claude over GPT?**
✅ Superior reasoning
✅ 200K context window
✅ Better at following instructions
✅ + GPT fallback for HA

**4. Why Redis Queue over Celery?**
✅ Simpler setup
✅ Great dashboard (RQ Dashboard)
✅ Python-native
✅ Sufficient for current scale

**Performance Metrics (Production):**

• Embedding generation: ~50ms/chunk
• Semantic search: <100ms (p95)
• End-to-end query: 3-6 seconds
• Concurrent users: 50+ (tested)
• Vector DB size: Scales linearly

### Day 28: Weekend Case Study - Real User Story

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
Case Study: How a 12-person startup saved $4,200/year with TellMeMo 💼

**Company:** DevTools startup (B2B SaaS, seed stage)

**Challenge:**

• 12 people across 3 teams (eng, product, sales)
• 30+ meetings/week (standups, customer calls, retros)
• Using Otter Business ($20/user) = $240/month = $2,880/year
• Sales team also using Gong (ouch 💸)

**Pain points:**

❌ Otter transcripts piling up (no one reads 45-min walls of text)
❌ Customer insights buried in sales call transcripts
❌ Engineering decisions forgotten across sprint cycles
❌ New hires asking "why did we build it this way?" (no good answer)

**The switch to TellMeMo (3 months ago):**

**Month 1: Testing**
• Uploaded last month of meeting transcripts
• Tried semantic search across all meetings
• Product team loved it
• Suggested rolling out company-wide

**Month 2: Full deployment**
• Everyone using TellMeMo
• Canceled Otter subscription
• Started using real-time meeting intelligence
• Integrated with existing Fireflies setup

**Month 3: Results**

**Time savings:**
• Product manager: 5 hours/week (was manually compiling sprint notes)
• Sales lead: 3 hours/week (customer insights for product)
• Engineering lead: 4 hours/week (onboarding new devs)
• Total: 12 hours/week = 48 hours/month = 576 hours/year

At $75k avg salary: **$20,880 value/year**

**Cost comparison:**
• Before: $240/month (Otter)
• After: $40/month (TellMeMo cloud)
• Annual savings: **$2,400**

**Unexpected wins:**

✅ **Customer intelligence goldmine**
Sales calls revealing feature requests product team didn't know about.
Query: "What features did enterprise customers request in Q3?"
→ Prioritized 2 features that closed 3 deals in Q4

✅ **Faster decision-making**
No more "didn't we already discuss this?" moments.
Query historical decisions before re-litigating.

✅ **Better onboarding**
New engineer productive in 1 week (was 3-4 weeks).
Asked TellMeMo instead of interrupting senior devs.

**Founder quote:**

"We thought we were just switching transcription tools. TellMeMo became our institutional memory. Best $40/month we spend."

**Their setup:**

• TellMeMo cloud (not self-hosted, didn't want DevOps overhead)
• Fireflies integration (auto-import transcripts)
• 3 main use cases:
  1. Product team: Feature research & decision docs
  2. Sales: Customer insights & objection handling
  3. Engineering: Architecture decisions & onboarding

**ROI:**
• $2,400/year direct savings (vs Otter)
• $20,880/year time savings
• $3,348 cost avoidance (vs Otter + avoided Gong expansion)
• **Total annual value: $26,628**

**Their advice for other startups:**

"Start by uploading your last 20 meetings. Ask 5 questions. You'll see the value immediately."

### Day 30: The Vision - Where We're Going

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
Where is TellMeMo going? The vision. 🚀

30 days ago we launched. Today, I want to share where we're headed.

**The problem we're REALLY solving:**

Every organization has a second brain: collective knowledge from thousands of conversations.

But it's:
❌ Scattered (Zoom, Slack, Docs, Email)
❌ Unsearchable (keyword search doesn't cut it)
❌ Disappearing (people leave, context goes with them)
❌ Underutilized (conversations don't compound value)

**The vision: Organizational Memory at Scale**

Imagine:

**5 years from now, when someone joins your company:**

Instead of "Here's our wiki" (which they won't read)

They ask:
→ "How does this team make decisions?"
→ "What customer problems are we solving?"
→ "Why did previous attempts at X fail?"
→ "What's our competitive advantage?"

And they get: Years of institutional wisdom, synthesized, with full context.

**For executives:**

Instead of "Let me check with my team"

They have:
→ Real-time portfolio intelligence
→ Cross-project risk visibility
→ Data-driven decision history
→ Strategic pattern recognition

**For product teams:**

Instead of "I think customers want..."

They query:
→ 500 customer conversations
→ Pattern analysis across segments
→ Feature request frequency & urgency
→ Win/loss themes from sales calls

**The future we're building:**

**Phase 1: Individual intelligence** (✅ DONE)
→ Transcript → Searchable insights

**Phase 2: Team intelligence** (← WE ARE HERE)
→ Shared knowledge base
→ Collaborative queries
→ Team-level summaries

**Phase 3: Organizational intelligence** (2025)
→ Cross-team insights
→ Company-wide search
→ Strategic pattern detection
→ Predictive analytics

**Phase 4: Ecosystem intelligence** (2026+)
→ Customer conversations (sales, CS, support)
→ Partner meetings
→ Industry trend analysis
→ Competitive intelligence synthesis

**How we'll get there:**

✅ **Open source**: Community-driven development
✅ **Interoperability**: Work with tools you already use
✅ **Privacy-first**: Self-hosting always an option
✅ **Cost transparency**: No extractive pricing
✅ **AI-native**: LLMs as a platform, not a feature

**The North Star:**

"Every team conversation compounds value instead of evaporating."

**What we need from you:**

🗣️ **Feedback**: Tell us what's broken
🤝 **Partnerships**: Integrations that make TellMeMo better
⭐ **Support**: Star our GitHub, share with colleagues
💡 **Ideas**: What would make this indispensable for you?

**This is just the beginning.**

30 days in. 3,000 days to go.

Let's build the future of organizational memory together.

## FINAL NOTES

**Engage, don't broadcast**: This is social MEDIA, not a billboard.

**Listen and adapt**: If a post type performs well, do more of it. If not, pivot.

**Document everything**: Track what works. Double down on winners.

**Build relationships**: DM people who engage, offer help, be genuine.

**Patience**: Virality is rare. Consistency compounds.

Good luck with your launch! 🚀
