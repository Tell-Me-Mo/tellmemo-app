**Example API Call:**
```python
async def stream_intelligence(transcript_buffer: str, context: dict) -> AsyncGenerator[dict, None]:
    """Stream intelligence detections from GPT."""
    response = await openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": STREAMING_INTELLIGENCE_PROMPT},

- [x] Write integration tests with mock handlers

Status: COMPLETED - 2025-10-26 10:15

**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Task 2.2
**Priority:** P0

**ID Generation Rationale:**
- **GPT generates UUIDs:** Allows GPT to reference questions in subsequent `answer` objects without backend round-trip
- **Backend validates:** Ensures data integrity and proper UUID format
- **Fallback to backend generation:** Handles cases where GPT produces invalid UUIDs
- **Prefix convention:** `q_` for questions, `a_` for actions makes debugging easier

  - [x] On WebSocket reconnect, send SYNC_STATE message with all active questions/actions
  - [x] Include current meeting context: session_id, timestamp
  - [ ] Resume live monitoring for questions that are still being tracked (Future enhancement)
  - [ ] Continue segment detection from last known state (Future enhancement)

  - [x] Update UI with any missed questions/actions (automatic via provider stream)
  - [x] Filter out dismissed items during reconciliation
  - [ ] Show notification: "Reconnected - synced X questions, Y actions" (Future enhancement)
- [x] **Late Join Handling:**

  - [x] Load all questions/actions from database via SYNC_STATE
  - [ ] Mark items with relative timestamps: "25 minutes ago" (Already implemented in UI widgets)
  - [ ] Provide "Hide Resolved" filter option (Future enhancement)
  - [ ] Scroll to most recent items by default (Already implemented in UI)

  - [x] Broadcast same state updates to all user devices (existing WebSocket broadcast mechanism)
  - [x] Synchronize user actions across devices via SharedPreferences persistence:
    - Dismiss on phone → persisted locally, won't show on next connect
    - Assign action → backend persists to database, synced on reconnect
  - [ ] Show active devices in UI: "Connected on 2 devices" (Future enhancement)
- [x] **Session State Lifecycle:**
  - [x] State persisted to PostgreSQL live_meeting_insights table
  - [x] Retrieved from PostgreSQL on WebSocket connect
  - [ ] Redis state management (Task 4.2 - deferred, using PostgreSQL directly for MVP)
  - [x] Persist final state to PostgreSQL (already happening real-time)
  - [ ] Handle orphaned sessions (Future cleanup task)
- [ ] **Concurrent Participant Conflicts:**
  - [ ] Detect when two users modify same action simultaneously (Future enhancement)
  - [ ] Use last-write-wins with timestamp (Backend database handles this)
  - [ ] Broadcast conflict notification (Future enhancement)
  - [ ] Show change history in action metadata (Future enhancement)
- [x] **Offline State Management:**
  - [x] If disconnected, continue showing last known state (read-only) - provider keeps state
  - [x] Dismissed items persisted to SharedPreferences across app restarts
  - [ ] Queue user actions locally while offline (Future enhancement)
  - [ ] On reconnect, replay queued actions to server (Future enhancement)
- [ ] Write integration tests for all reconnection scenarios (Post-MVP)
- [ ] Test with simulated network interruptions (1s, 5s, 30s, 60s) (Post-MVP)

## APPENDIX E: FOUR-TIER ANSWER DISCOVERY FLOW

### Tier Priority & Execution

```
Question Detected at t=0s
    ↓
    ├─→ Tier 1: RAG Search (parallel, 2s timeout)
    │   ├─ Found documents → Stream to UI with "📚 From Documents" label
    │   └─ No results → Continue
    │
    ├─→ Tier 2: Meeting Context Search (parallel, 1.5s timeout)
    │   ├─ Found earlier answer → Send to UI with "💬 Earlier in Meeting" label
    │   └─ No results → Continue
    │
    ├─→ Tier 3: Live Conversation Monitoring (15s window)
    │   ├─ Answer detected in conversation → Mark resolved with "👂 Answered Live" label
    │   └─ No answer after 15s → Continue to Tier 4
    │
    └─→ Tier 4: GPT-Generated Answer (3s timeout)
        ├─ GPT generates answer (confidence >70%) → Display with "🤖 AI Answer" + disclaimer
        └─ GPT cannot answer or low confidence → Mark as UNANSWERED
```

### UI Answer Source Labels

**Purpose:** Users must clearly understand where each answer came from to assess reliability.

| Tier | Source Label | Icon | Color | Reliability Indicator |
|------|-------------|------|-------|----------------------|
| **Tier 1** | "From Documents" | 📚 | Blue | High - From verified documents |
| **Tier 2** | "Earlier in Meeting" | 💬 | Purple | High - From actual meeting discussion |
| **Tier 3** | "Answered Live" | 👂 | Green | High - Live conversation response |
| **Tier 4** | "AI Answer" | 🤖 | Orange | Medium - AI-generated, needs verification |

### Tier 4 Disclaimer Requirements

When displaying GPT-generated answers:

1. **Prominent Badge:** "Generated by AI" badge next to answer
2. **Disclaimer Text:** "This answer was generated by AI based on general knowledge, not from your documents or meeting"
3. **Confidence Score:** Display GPT's self-assessed confidence (if >70%)
4. **Visual Distinction:** Use different background color or border to separate from other answer sources
5. **User Verification Prompt:** Encourage users to verify answer accuracy

### Answer Source Priority in Database

Store `answer_source` field in `live_meeting_insights` table:

```sql
answer_source VARCHAR CHECK (answer_source IN (
    'rag',              -- Tier 1: Found in documents
    'meeting_context',  -- Tier 2: Earlier in meeting
    'live_conversation',-- Tier 3: Live monitoring
    'gpt_generated',    -- Tier 4: AI-generated
    'user_provided',    -- User manually marked as answered
    'unanswered'        -- No answer found
))
```
