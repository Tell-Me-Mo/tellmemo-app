**Example API Call:**
```python
async def stream_intelligence(transcript_buffer: str, context: dict) -> AsyncGenerator[dict, None]:
    """Stream intelligence detections from GPT."""
    response = await openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5-mini",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": STREAMING_INTELLIGENCE_PROMPT},

- [x] Write integration tests with mock handlers

Status: COMPLETED - 2025-10-26 10:15

**Complexity:** Medium
**Dependencies:** Task 2.2
**Priority:** P0

**ID Generation Rationale:**
- **GPT generates UUIDs:** Allows GPT to reference questions in subsequent `answer` objects without backend round-trip
- **Backend validates:** Ensures data integrity and proper UUID format
- **Fallback to backend generation:** Handles cases where GPT produces invalid UUIDs
- **Prefix convention:** `q_` for questions, `a_` for actions makes debugging easier

```sql
answer_source VARCHAR CHECK (answer_source IN (
    'rag',              -- Tier 1: Found in documents
    'meeting_context',  -- Tier 2: Earlier in meeting
    'live_conversation',-- Tier 3: Live monitoring
    'gpt_generated',    -- Tier 4: AI-generated
    'user_provided',    -- User manually marked as answered
    'unanswered'        -- No answer found
))
```
