# Backend Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the PM Master V2 FastAPI backend, including test structure, coverage targets, and feature checklist.

## Testing Philosophy

- **Integration-First**: Prioritize integration tests over unit tests (higher ROI)
- **User Flow Coverage**: Test complete workflows, not isolated functions
- **Mock External Services**: LLM APIs, vector DB for consistent tests
- **Realistic Test Data**: Use fixtures that mirror production scenarios
- **Coverage Target**: 60-70% (focus on routers/, services/, core logic)

| 🟡 Minor | File size validation returns 500 instead of 400 | `content.py:242-249` | Add `except ValueError as e: raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))` to main execution path | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | Missing multi-tenant validation in content availability | `content_availability.py:44-90, 92-127, 129-175` & `content_availability_service.py:22-110, 112-217, 219-330, 342-407` | Add organization_id validation in all three endpoints and service methods to prevent cross-organization data access | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | `Conversation.project_id` not nullable | `conversation.py:18` | Change `nullable=False` → `nullable=True` to support org/program/portfolio-level conversations | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | `Conversation.project_id` has FK constraint to projects table | `conversation.py:18` | Remove FK constraint - field now stores project/program/portfolio IDs generically | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | Portfolio query doesn't deduplicate project IDs | `queries.py:554` | Use `list(set([...]))` to deduplicate when project appears in both direct and program lists | ✅ FIXED |
| 🟡 Minor | Project query doesn't limit sources to 10 | `queries.py:304` | Add `[:10]` slice to sources for consistency with other query endpoints | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | MRL vector insertion not handling named vectors | `multi_tenant_vector_store.py:330-363` | When MRL is enabled, collections use named vectors but insert_vectors sends single vector list. Need to convert single vector to dict of named vectors `{"vector_128": [...], "vector_256": [...], "vector_512": [...], "vector_768": [...]}` | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | get_collection_info fails with MRL enabled | `multi_tenant_vector_store.py:754-768` | Method tries to access `vectors.size` but with MRL enabled, `vectors` is a dict not VectorParams. Need to handle both single and named vectors. | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | **Missing multi-tenant validation in get_summary** | `unified_summaries.py:322-408` | No organization validation - users can access summaries from other organizations.

| 🔴 Critical | **Background job references undefined `current_user`** | `unified_summaries.py:592,602,612` | In `generate_summary_with_job` function, `current_user` is used but not in scope. Need to pass `created_by` and `created_by_id` in metadata and retrieve from there | ✅ FIXED |
| 🟡 Minor | **Missing `project_id` in list_summaries response** | `unified_summaries.py:489-514` | Response doesn't include `project_id` field (present in other response models). Add `project_id=str(summary.project_id) if summary.project_id else None` to response | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | **No authentication on hierarchy_summaries endpoints** | `hierarchy_summaries.py:42-43,98-99` | Added `Depends(get_current_user)` and `Depends(get_current_organization)` to both GET endpoints. POST endpoints deleted. | ✅ FIXED |

| 🔴 Critical | **No multi-tenant isolation in get_portfolio_summaries** | `hierarchy_summaries.py:118` | Added `Summary.organization_id == current_org.id` to WHERE clause for multi-tenant filtering | ✅ FIXED |
| 🟡 Minor | **Invalid UUID returns 500 instead of 400** | `hierarchy_summaries.py:53-56,109-112` | Moved UUID validation before try block so HTTPException(400) is not caught by generic handler | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | **Missing authentication on create_risk** | `risks_tasks.py:152-160` | Add `Depends(get_current_user)` and `Depends(get_current_organization)` dependencies | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | **Missing multi-tenant validation in create_risk** | `risks_tasks.py:162-173` | Add organization validation - verify project belongs to current organization before creating risk | ✅ FIXED |

| 🟡 Info | **No authentication on WebSocket /ws/jobs** | `websocket_jobs.py:169-253` | WebSocket authentication requires token-based auth (query param or cookie) - documented as known limitation | ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATION |
| 🟡 Minor | **No project existence validation in GET /projects/{project_id}/jobs** | `jobs.py:293-343` | Add validation that project exists before listing jobs | ✅ FIXED |

| 🔴 Critical | **Missing method `_generate_project_reports` in scheduler service** | `scheduler.py:118` | Fixed method name from `_generate_project_reports` to `_generate_weekly_reports` | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | **Missing method `reschedule_project_reports` in scheduler service** | `scheduler.py:161` | Fixed method name from `reschedule_project_reports` to `reschedule_weekly_reports` | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | **No multi-tenant validation in trigger_project_reports** | `scheduler.py:79-96` | Added project existence validation and organization ownership check, returns 404 for cross-org access | ✅ FIXED |
| 🟡 Minor | **Test integration endpoint catches HTTPException and returns 200** | `integrations.py:334-339` | Added `except HTTPException: raise` before generic exception handler to properly return 404 for unknown integration types | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | **No multi-tenant validation in transcription endpoint** | `transcription.py:293-428` | The `/api/transcribe` endpoint doesn't validate that the specified `project_id` belongs to the authenticated user's organization. Added validation at line 360-395 that queries project with organization_id check and returns 404 if project doesn't exist or belongs to different org. | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | **Type mismatch in notifications router** | `notifications.py:99,170,233,288,392` | All notification endpoints use incorrect type hint `current_org_id: Optional[str]` but `get_current_organization` dependency returns an `Organization` object, not a string. This causes `AttributeError: 'Organization' object has no attribute 'replace'` when service tries to do `uuid.UUID(organization_id)`. Fixed by changing type to `Optional[Organization]` and using `str(current_org.id) if current_org else None` when passing to service. | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | **No multi-tenant validation in get_project_activities** | `activity_service.py:82-94` | Service method accepts `organization_id` parameter but NEVER USES IT in the query. Users can potentially access activities from other organizations' projects if they know the project ID. **FIX:** Added project ownership validation that queries project with organization_id check at lines 82-94, returns empty list if project doesn't belong to organization. | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | **No multi-tenant validation in get_recent_activities** | `activity_service.py:133-147` | Service method accepts `organization_id` parameter but NEVER USES IT. Users can pass any project IDs and retrieve activities without validating project ownership. **FIX:** Added validation at lines 133-147 that filters requested project_ids to only include projects belonging to the organization, returns empty list if no valid projects found. | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | **No multi-tenant validation in delete_project_activities** | `activity_service.py:306-318` | Service method accepts `organization_id` parameter but doesn't validate project ownership before deleting activities. Admin from one org could delete activities from another org's project. **FIX:** Added project ownership validation at lines 306-318, returns 0 deleted count if project doesn't belong to organization. | ✅ FIXED |
| 🔴 Critical | **update_conversation fails for organization-level conversations** | `conversations.py:197-252` | The endpoint compares `Conversation.project_id == project_id` where project_id is the string 'organization', but the database expects a UUID. This causes a 500 error when trying to update organization-level conversations. **FIX:** Added conditional logic to check if `project_id == 'organization'` and use `.is_(None)` for the query filter (lines 198-219). Also fixed response to return 'organization' instead of None for project_id (line 247). | ✅ FIXED |

## Coverage Goals

### Minimum Coverage Thresholds
- **Overall**: 60%
- **Critical Paths** (routers/, services/): 80%
- **Models** (database.py, models.py): 70%
- **Utils** (utils/): 50%

### Coverage Report
```bash
# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Open in browser
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
1. **Mock External APIs**: Never hit real Claude API or external services in tests
2. **Use Fixtures**: Reuse test data across multiple tests
3. **Test Happy Path First**: Then edge cases and error scenarios
4. **Isolate Tests**: Each test should be independent
5. **Descriptive Names**: `test_upload_meeting_with_invalid_format_returns_422`
6. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
7. **Test Error Cases**: Don't just test success scenarios

### ❌ Don't:
1. **Test Implementation Details**: Test behavior, not internals
2. **Skip Test Cleanup**: Always clean up database/resources
3. **Hard-code Test Data**: Use factories and fixtures
4. **Test Framework Code**: Don't test FastAPI internals
5. **Ignore Flaky Tests**: Fix or remove unstable tests
6. **Commit Commented Tests**: Delete or fix broken tests

## Example Test Cases

        "project_id": project_id
    })
    assert search.status_code == 200
    assert len(search.json()["results"]) > 0

    # Step 5: Generate weekly report
    report = test_client.post("/api/v1/reports/weekly", json={
        "project_id": project_id,
        "week_start": "2024-01-15"
    })
