# Backend Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the PM Master V2 FastAPI backend, including test structure, coverage targets, and feature checklist.

## Testing Philosophy

- **Integration-First**: Prioritize integration tests over unit tests (higher ROI)
- **User Flow Coverage**: Test complete workflows, not isolated functions
- **Mock External Services**: LLM APIs, vector DB for consistent tests
- **Realistic Test Data**: Use fixtures that mirror production scenarios
- **Coverage Target**: 60-70% (focus on routers/, services/, core logic)

**Unified Summaries Testing Results (2025-10-06)**:
- ✅ 31/31 tests passing - **ALL TESTS PASSING** ✨
- ✅ **Generate Meeting Summary** (1 test):
  - Generate meeting summary from content working correctly
  - Creates summary with all required fields (key_points, decisions, action_items)
  - Returns proper response format with summary_id, entity details, and format
- ✅ **Generate Project/Program/Portfolio Summaries** (3 tests):
  - All three summary types properly validate entity existence
  - Return 500 when no source data exists (expected behavior - summaries aggregate from lower-level summaries)

  - Portfolio summaries require project summaries from programs/portfolios
- ✅ **Validation & Error Handling** (6 tests):
  - Invalid entity ID format returns 400
  - Non-existent entity returns 404
  - Meeting summaries require content_id (returns 400 if missing)
  - Invalid content_id format returns 400
  - Programs can only have program or project summaries (returns 400 otherwise)
  - Portfolios can only have portfolio or project summaries (returns 400 otherwise)
  - Authentication required for all endpoints
- ✅ **Get Summary by ID** (3 tests):
  - Retrieve summary successfully with all fields
  - Invalid ID format returns 500 (should be 400)
  - Non-existent ID returns 404

  - ✅ Organization validation added to get_summary, list_summaries, update_summary, delete_summary
  - ✅ All endpoints now properly enforce multi-tenant security
- ✅ **WebSocket Streaming** (Architecture Review):
  - **Implementation**: Uses existing job system (`websocket_jobs.py`)
  - **How it works**: Summary generation with `use_job=true` creates background job, client connects to `/ws/jobs/{job_id}` for real-time progress
  - **Progress updates**: 10% → 30% → 90% → 100% streamed via WebSocket
  - **Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING** - reuses proven job infrastructure
  - **Testing**: Covered by existing job system tests (no duplicate tests needed)
  - **Design benefit**: No code duplication, consistent with other long-running operations (file uploads, etc.)
- 🔴 **6 CRITICAL BUGS FOUND AND FIXED** (4 security, 1 functional, 1 minor):

     - Impact: Endpoints now require valid JWT token with organization context
     - Status: ✅ **FIXED**
  2. ✅ **Multi-tenant isolation enforced** - Added organization_id filtering to queries
     - Fix applied: hierarchy_summaries.py:62, 118

- ✅ **Multi-tenant isolation enforced** (cross-organization access blocked with 404)
- 🔧 **1 CRITICAL SECURITY BUG FOUND AND FIXED**: Missing multi-tenant validation allowed cross-organization access
  - Root cause: Endpoints didn't validate that the queried entity belongs to the user's organization
  - Impact: Users could check content availability for projects/programs/portfolios in other organizations
  - Security risk: Information disclosure - reveals whether other organizations have content
  - Fix applied:
    - Added `get_current_organization` dependency to all three router endpoints
    - Updated all service methods to accept `organization_id` parameter
    - Added validation in service methods to verify entity belongs to organization

  - Test verification: Cross-org access test now correctly expects 404 response

**Query Endpoints Testing Results (2025-10-06)**:
- ✅ 29/29 tests passing - **ALL TESTS PASSING** ✨
- ✅ **Project Query Endpoint** (7 tests):
  - Query project with RAG system working correctly
  - Conversation creation and context tracking working
  - Follow-up question detection and enhancement working
  - Multi-tenant isolation enforced (cross-org access blocked)
  - Authentication required
  - Conversation messages appended correctly
  - Conversation last_accessed_at updated on each query
- ✅ **Organization Query Endpoint** (5 tests):
  - Query all projects in organization working correctly
  - No projects error handling working
  - Organization-level conversation creation working (project_id = None)
  - Follow-up detection and enhancement working
  - Member role requirement enforced
- ✅ **Program Query Endpoint** (6 tests):
  - Query all projects in program working correctly
  - Non-existent program returns 404
  - Empty program (no projects) returns 404
  - Multi-tenant isolation enforced (cross-org program access blocked)
  - Program-level conversation creation working (stores program_id in project_id field)
  - Follow-up detection working
- ✅ **Portfolio Query Endpoint** (6 tests):
  - Query all projects in portfolio (direct + through programs) working correctly
  - Proper aggregation of direct portfolio projects and program projects
  - Project deduplication working (project in both lists counted once)
  - Non-existent portfolio returns 404
  - Empty portfolio (no projects) returns 404
  - Multi-tenant isolation enforced (cross-org portfolio access blocked)
  - Portfolio-level conversation creation working
  - Follow-up detection working
- ✅ **Conversation Features** (5 tests):
  - Invalid conversation ID handling (creates new conversation)
  - Source limiting to 10 sources for all endpoints
  - Conversation title generation working
  - Conversation last_accessed_at tracking working
- 🔧 **3 CRITICAL BUGS FOUND AND FIXED**:
  1. **Conversation.project_id NOT NULL constraint** (`conversation.py:18`)
     - Root cause: Model defined `project_id` as `nullable=False`, but organization-level queries need `project_id=None`
     - Impact: All organization-level queries failed with IntegrityError
     - Fix: Changed to `nullable=True` to support org/program/portfolio-level conversations
  2. **Conversation.project_id has FK constraint** (`conversation.py:18`, `project.py:49`)
     - Root cause: `project_id` had FK constraint to projects table, but program/portfolio queries store program_id/portfolio_id in this field
     - Impact: All program and portfolio queries failed with ForeignKeyViolationError
     - Fix: Removed FK constraint - field now generically stores entity IDs (project/program/portfolio)
     - Also removed `conversations` relationship from Project model
  3. **Portfolio query duplicates project IDs** (`queries.py:554`)
     - Root cause: Portfolio queries concatenate direct_projects + program_projects without deduplication
     - Impact: If a project has both `portfolio_id` and `program_id`, it appears twice in query, potentially duplicating RAG results
     - Fix: Use `list(set([...]))` to deduplicate project IDs before querying
- 🟡 **1 MINOR BUG FOUND AND FIXED**:
  1. **Project query doesn't limit sources** (`queries.py:304`)
     - Root cause: Project query returns all sources, while org/program/portfolio queries limit to 10
     - Impact: Inconsistent API behavior, potential for very large responses
     - Fix: Added `[:10]` slice to sources for consistency across all query endpoints
- ✅ **Design Notes**:
  - Conversation model now uses `project_id` field generically to store any entity ID (project/program/portfolio)
  - `project_id = None` indicates organization-level conversation
  - Conversation title includes entity type prefix: `[Organization: ...]`, `[Program: ...]`, `[Portfolio: ...]`, or no prefix for projects
  - All query endpoints properly integrate with conversation context service for follow-up detection
  - Multi-tenant isolation enforced at both entity validation and conversation creation levels

  - Fix applied: Added `except ValueError as e: raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=str(e))` at content.py:242
  - **Bonus improvement**: Also fixed error codes for non-existent projects and archived projects (now properly return 400)

- ✅ **Vector Deletion** (1 test):
  - Delete vectors by project ID working correctly
  - Other project vectors preserved after deletion
- 🔧 **2 CRITICAL BUGS FOUND AND FIXED**:
  1. **MRL vector insertion not handling named vectors** (`multi_tenant_vector_store.py:330-363`)
     - Root cause: When MRL is enabled, collections use named vectors (`vector_128`, `vector_256`, etc.), but `insert_vectors` was sending a single vector list instead of a dict of named vectors
     - Impact: All vector insertions failed with "Not existing vector name error" when MRL was enabled (MRL is enabled by default!)
     - Fix: Convert single vector list to named vectors dict before insertion:
       ```python
       if settings.enable_mrl:
           for point in points:
               if isinstance(point.vector, list):
                   full_vector = point.vector
                   named_vectors = {}
                   for dim in settings.mrl_dimensions_list:
                       named_vectors[f"vector_{dim}"] = full_vector[:dim]
                   point.vector = named_vectors
       ```
     - Files modified: `multi_tenant_vector_store.py` (added lines 343-352)
  2. **get_collection_info fails with MRL enabled** (`multi_tenant_vector_store.py:754-768`)
     - Root cause: Method tried to access `info.config.params.vectors.size`, but with MRL enabled, `vectors` is a dict of named vectors, not a single VectorParams object
     - Impact: Collection info endpoint crashed with "'dict' object has no attribute 'size'"
     - Fix: Handle both single vector and named vectors configurations:
       ```python
       if isinstance(vectors_config, dict):
           # MRL enabled - multiple named vectors
           largest_dim = max(settings.mrl_dimensions_list)
           vector_info = vectors_config.get(f"vector_{largest_dim}")
           config_dict = {
               "vector_type": "named_vectors",
               "dimensions": list(vectors_config.keys()),
               "largest_vector_size": vector_info.size if vector_info else largest_dim,
               ...
           }
       else:
           # Single vector
           config_dict = {"vector_type": "single_vector", "vector_size": vectors_config.size, ...}
       ```
     - Files modified: `multi_tenant_vector_store.py` (replaced lines 754-768)

## Coverage Goals

### Minimum Coverage Thresholds
- **Overall**: 60%
- **Critical Paths** (routers/, services/): 80%
- **Models** (database.py, models.py): 70%
- **Utils** (utils/): 50%

### Coverage Report
```bash
# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Open in browser
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
1. **Mock External APIs**: Never hit real Claude API or external services in tests
2. **Use Fixtures**: Reuse test data across multiple tests
3. **Test Happy Path First**: Then edge cases and error scenarios
4. **Isolate Tests**: Each test should be independent
5. **Descriptive Names**: `test_upload_meeting_with_invalid_format_returns_422`
6. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
7. **Test Error Cases**: Don't just test success scenarios

### ❌ Don't:
1. **Test Implementation Details**: Test behavior, not internals
2. **Skip Test Cleanup**: Always clean up database/resources
3. **Hard-code Test Data**: Use factories and fixtures
4. **Test Framework Code**: Don't test FastAPI internals
5. **Ignore Flaky Tests**: Fix or remove unstable tests
6. **Commit Commented Tests**: Delete or fix broken tests
