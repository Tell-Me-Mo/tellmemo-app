   [10:12] Sarah: "We're deploying on Friday, October 25th"
   Click timestamp to jump to that moment →
```

**Tier 3: Live Conversation Monitoring - 15 second window**

**What It Does:**
- Monitors subsequent conversation for answers
- Semantically matches answers to questions
- Marks question resolved when confident answer detected

**Display:**
- Label: "👂 Answered Live"
- Shows speaker and answer text
- Updates question status to "Answered"

**Example:**
```
❓ Question: "Who's responsible for the API documentation?"
   (monitoring conversation...)

   [10:18] John: "I'll handle the API docs, should be done by next week"
   Status: Answered ✓
```

🤖 AI Answer (Tier 4) - Confidence: 78%
   ⚠️ AI-generated, not from your documents or meeting
   "Typical infrastructure investments show ROI within 18-36 months,
   depending on scope. Cloud infrastructure often delivers faster
   returns (12-18 months) vs on-premises (24-36 months)."

   Please verify this information with authoritative sources.
```

### Question Card States

**Searching State:**
- Shows spinning indicator
- "Searching knowledge base..." message
- Tier 1 and 2 running in parallel

GPT-5-mini automatically detects:
- Commitments ("I will...", "We should...")
- Task assignments ("John, can you...", "Sarah will...")
- Deadlines ("by Friday", "next week", "before Q4")

**Accumulation Phase:**

As conversation progresses, action items update with more details:

**Example Flow:**
```
[10:20] Sarah: "We need to update the API documentation"
✅ Action Tracked
   Description: "Update API documentation"
   Completeness: 40% (description only, no owner/deadline)

[10:21] John: "I can handle that"
✅ Action Updated
   Description: "Update API documentation"
   Owner: John
   Completeness: 70% (description + owner, no deadline)

[10:22] Sarah: "Can you have it done by next Friday?"
[10:23] John: "Sure, I'll have it ready by Friday"
✅ Action Updated
   Description: "Update API documentation"
   Owner: John
   Deadline: Friday, November 1st
   Completeness: 100% ✓
```

**Completeness Scoring:**
- Description only: 40%
- Description + (Owner OR Deadline): 70%
- Description + Owner + Deadline: 100% ✓

**Smart Alerting:**

Actions trigger alerts only at natural breakpoints:
- Segment transitions (topic changes)
- Meeting end
- When high-confidence action is incomplete

**No alert fatigue** - system waits for appropriate moments.

**Action Card Features:**
- Real-time status updates (tracking badge)
- Assign to team members
- Set/edit deadline
- Mark as complete
- Dismiss if incorrect
- Export to task management

- More content = better answers

**2. Enable AI Assistant at Meeting Start**
- Captures entire conversation
- Builds meeting context for Tier 2 search
- Early questions can reference later discussions

**3. Speak Clearly**
- State names explicitly ("John will handle this")
- Mention deadlines clearly ("by next Friday")
- Avoid pronouns when assigning ("he will do it")

**4. Review Insights in Real-Time**
- Mark questions answered if you got your answer
- Correct action item assignments if wrong
- Dismiss false positives immediately

**5. Use Natural Language**
- No special syntax required
- Ask questions naturally
- Make commitments as you normally would

**6. Trust the System**
- Answers clearly show their source
- AI-generated answers are rare and marked
- False positives can be dismissed

### Cost Management

**Pricing:**
- AssemblyAI: $0.90/hour (transcription + speaker diarization)
- GPT-5-mini: ~$0.15/hour (streaming intelligence)
- **Total: ~$1.05/hour per meeting**

**Cost Optimization:**
- Single connection per meeting (shared across participants)
- Enable only when needed (toggle mid-meeting)
- Efficient streaming reduces token usage
- Local embedding model (no API costs)

**Example:**
- 1-hour meeting with 5 participants = $1.05 total
- Monthly (20 meetings/month) = ~$21/month
- Yearly (240 meetings/year) = ~$252/year

### Troubleshooting

**No transcription appearing:**
- Check microphone permissions
- Verify AssemblyAI API key configured
- Ensure audio level indicator shows activity
- Try toggling AI Assistant OFF then ON

**Questions not being detected:**
- Verify OpenAI API key configured (for GPT-5-mini)
- Check that questions are being spoken clearly
- Review transcript to ensure accurate transcription
- Some rhetorical questions may be filtered

**Answers not appearing:**
- Tier 1 requires uploaded content (knowledge base)
- Tier 2 requires earlier meeting discussion
- Tier 3 monitors for 15 seconds after question
- Tier 4 fallback only triggers if all else fails

**Action items missing:**
- Speak commitments explicitly ("I will..." not "maybe...")
- Include owner and deadline for completeness
- System filters uncertain statements

**Performance issues:**
- Virtualized list handles long meetings efficiently
- Older transcripts load on-demand
- Try collapsing transcription panel if not needed
- Refresh browser if WebSocket connection drops
