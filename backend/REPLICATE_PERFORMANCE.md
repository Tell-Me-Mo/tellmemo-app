# Replicate Transcription Performance Optimization

## Model Upgrade: incredibly-fast-whisper

### Previous Implementation
- **Model**: `openai/whisper` (standard Whisper Large v3)
- **Performance**: 696 seconds for 30-minute audio
- **Realtime Factor**: 0.38x (slower than realtime)
- **Issue**: Extremely slow, not suitable for production use

### Current Implementation
- **Model**: `vaibhavs10/incredibly-fast-whisper` (optimized Whisper Large v3)
- **Version**: `3ab86df6c8f54c11309d4d1f930ac292bad43ace52d10c80d87eb258b3c9f79c`
- **Performance**: ~150 minutes transcribed in 98 seconds
- **Realtime Factor**: ~91.8x (91.8x faster than realtime)
- **Expected for 30-min audio**: ~20 seconds (estimated)
- **Speedup**: ~242x faster than previous implementation

### Key Optimizations

1. **GPU Acceleration**: Uses L40S GPU with optimized inference pipeline
2. **Batch Processing**: Default batch_size=24 for parallel processing
3. **Hugging Face Transformers**: Uses optimized transformer implementation
4. **Same Quality**: Maintains Whisper Large v3 accuracy

### API Parameters

```python
input_params = {
    "audio": audio_file,
    "task": "transcribe",  # or "translate"
    "batch_size": 24,  # Optimized default
    "timestamp": "chunk",  # chunk-level timestamps
    "language": "en"  # Optional, auto-detect if omitted
}
```

### Performance Comparison

| Service | Model | 30-min Audio | Realtime Factor | Quality |
|---------|-------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Previous Replicate** | openai/whisper (large-v3) | 696s | 0.38x | Excellent |
| **Current Replicate** | incredibly-fast-whisper (large-v3) | ~20s | ~90x | Excellent |
| **Salad API** | Whisper (medium/large) | ~15-30s | ~60-120x | Excellent |

### Recommendation

**incredibly-fast-whisper** is now competitive with Salad API for speed while maintaining the same Whisper Large v3 quality. This makes Replicate a viable primary or backup transcription service.
