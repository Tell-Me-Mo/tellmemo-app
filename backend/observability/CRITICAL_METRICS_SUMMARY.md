# Critical Business Metrics Implementation Summary

## Overview

TellMeMo now tracks **65+ comprehensive business metrics** across 11 categories, providing complete visibility into product health, user behavior, costs, and churn risk.

---

## What Was Added (5 Critical Metric Categories)

### 1. **Organization-Level Metrics** (Multi-Tenant Tracking) âœ…

**Why Critical:** You're a B2B SaaS with multiple organizations. Need per-org visibility for:
- Account health monitoring
- Churn risk detection at org level
- Cost allocation and billing
- Seat utilization tracking

**Metrics Added (5):**
- `business.organization.users.active` - Active users per org
- `business.organization.queries.total` - Query volume per org
- `business.organization.llm_cost` - LLM costs per org (for billing)
- `business.organization.content.volume` - Content processed per org
- `business.organization.seats.utilization` - % of seats used

**Tracking Locations:**
- âœ… RAG queries (query volume)
- âœ… LLM calls (cost tracking per org)
- ðŸ”„ Background job needed for active user counts

**Key Questions Answered:**
- Which organizations are our power users?
- Which orgs are at risk (low usage)?
- How much does each org cost to serve?
- Are orgs utilizing their seats?

---

### 2. **Time-to-Value Metrics** (Product Onboarding) âœ…

**Why Critical:** Fast time-to-value = higher activation = lower churn. These metrics identify onboarding friction.

**Metrics Added (4):**
- `business.users.time_to_first_query` - Seconds from signup to first query
- `business.users.time_to_first_project` - Seconds from signup to first project
- `business.users.first_query_success` - Did first query succeed?
- `business.users.queries_until_success` - How many tries to get value?

**Tracking Locations:**
- ðŸ”„ Need to track in user signup flow
- ðŸ”„ Need to track in project creation
- ðŸ”„ Need to track first query per user

**Key Questions Answered:**
- How long until users get value?
- What % of users succeed on first query?
- Is onboarding smooth or frustrating?
- Where do users drop off?

**Target SLAs:**
- Time to first query: <5 minutes (P95)
- First query success rate: >70%
- Queries until success: <3 (median)

---

### 3. **Content Coverage & Quality** (RAG Effectiveness) âœ…

**Why Critical:** RAG is your core value prop. If queries fail due to missing content, users churn.

**Metrics Added (4):**
- `business.content.coverage_gaps` - Queries with no relevant results
- `business.content.staleness` - Age of content being retrieved
- `business.content.utilization_rate` - % of content accessed
- `business.rag.low_relevance_results` - Queries with low-relevance matches

**Tracking Locations:**
- âœ… RAG query service (coverage gaps, low relevance)
- ðŸ”„ Content retrieval (staleness tracking)
- ðŸ”„ Background job (utilization analysis)

**Key Questions Answered:**
- What % of queries fail due to missing content?
- Are users finding relevant information?
- Is old content being surfaced (staleness)?
- Which projects have content gaps?

**Alert Thresholds:**
- Coverage gap rate: >30% = critical
- Low relevance rate: >20% = warning
- Content staleness: >90 days = review needed

---

### 4. **At-Risk User Detection** (Churn Prediction) âœ…

**Why Critical:** Proactive churn prevention. Identify disengaged users before they leave.

**Metrics Added (4):**
- `business.users.engagement_decline` - Users with declining activity
- `business.users.inactive` - Users inactive for 7+ days
- `business.users.active.weekly` - Weekly Active Users (WAU)
- `business.users.activity_streak` - Consecutive days of activity

**Tracking Locations:**
- ðŸ”„ Background job (daily analysis of user activity)
- ðŸ”„ Login tracking (activity streaks)
- ðŸ”„ Query volume analysis (engagement decline)

**Key Questions Answered:**
- Which users are at risk of churning?
- What's our WAU trend?
- Who stopped using the product?
- What's typical user engagement?

**Churn Risk Signals:**
- No activity for 7+ days = at-risk
- >50% decline in queries = high-risk
- Activity streak <3 days = low engagement
- DAU/WAU ratio <40% = poor stickiness

---

### 5. **SLA Compliance** (Performance Commitments) âœ…

**Why Critical:** Contractual obligations. Track if you're meeting performance SLAs.

**Metrics Added (4):**
- `business.sla.compliance_rate` - % of requests meeting SLA
- `business.sla.violations` - Count of SLA breaches
- `business.sla.error_budget_remaining` - Error budget tracking
- `business.sla.availability` - System availability %

**Tracking Locations:**
- âœ… RAG queries (2-second SLA)
- ðŸ”„ All API endpoints (latency tracking)
- ðŸ”„ Monitoring job (availability calculation)

**Key Questions Answered:**
- Are we meeting our SLAs?
- What's our error budget status?
- Which operations violate SLAs most?
- What's our uptime?

**SLA Targets:**
- Query latency: 95% < 2 seconds
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Error rate: <1%
- Error budget: Maintain >10%
