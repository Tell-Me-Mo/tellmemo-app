# Backend Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the PM Master V2 FastAPI backend, including test structure, coverage targets, and feature checklist.

## Testing Philosophy

- **Integration-First**: Prioritize integration tests over unit tests (higher ROI)
- **User Flow Coverage**: Test complete workflows, not isolated functions
- **Mock External Services**: LLM APIs, vector DB for consistent tests
- **Realistic Test Data**: Use fixtures that mirror production scenarios
- **Coverage Target**: 60-70% (focus on routers/, services/, core logic)

## Test Execution

### Run All Tests
```bash
pytest
```

### Run with Coverage
```bash
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html
```

### Run Specific Test Types
```bash
# Unit tests only
pytest tests/unit/

# Integration tests only
pytest tests/integration/

# E2E tests only
pytest tests/e2e/

# Specific test file
pytest tests/integration/test_api_meetings.py

# Specific test function
pytest tests/integration/test_api_meetings.py::test_upload_meeting_success
```

### Run with Markers
```bash
# Fast tests only (skip slow integration tests)
pytest -m "not slow"

# Critical path tests only
pytest -m critical
```

## Coverage Goals

### Minimum Coverage Thresholds
- **Overall**: 60%
- **Critical Paths** (routers/, services/): 80%
- **Models** (database.py, models.py): 70%
- **Utils** (utils/): 50%

### Coverage Report
```bash
# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Open in browser
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do:
1. **Mock External APIs**: Never hit real Claude API or external services in tests
2. **Use Fixtures**: Reuse test data across multiple tests
3. **Test Happy Path First**: Then edge cases and error scenarios
4. **Isolate Tests**: Each test should be independent
5. **Descriptive Names**: `test_upload_meeting_with_invalid_format_returns_422`
6. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Clear test structure
7. **Test Error Cases**: Don't just test success scenarios

### ❌ Don't:
1. **Test Implementation Details**: Test behavior, not internals
2. **Skip Test Cleanup**: Always clean up database/resources
3. **Hard-code Test Data**: Use factories and fixtures
4. **Test Framework Code**: Don't test FastAPI internals
5. **Ignore Flaky Tests**: Fix or remove unstable tests
6. **Commit Commented Tests**: Delete or fix broken tests

## Example Test Cases

### Integration Test Example
```python
# tests/integration/test_api_meetings.py
import pytest
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_upload_meeting_and_generate_summary(
    test_client: TestClient,
    sample_project,
    sample_meeting_transcript,
    mock_llm_client
):
    # Arrange
    upload_data = {
        "project_id": sample_project.id,
        "transcript": sample_meeting_transcript,
        "date": "2024-01-15",
        "participants": ["Alice", "Bob"]
    }

    # Act
    response = test_client.post("/api/v1/meetings", json=upload_data)

    # Assert
    assert response.status_code == 201
    meeting_id = response.json()["id"]

    # Verify summary was generated
    summary_response = test_client.get(f"/api/v1/meetings/{meeting_id}/summary")
    assert summary_response.status_code == 200
    assert "action_items" in summary_response.json()
```

### E2E Test Example

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_complete_meeting_intelligence_flow(test_client, mock_services):
    """Test: Upload meeting → Generate summary → Search insights → Generate report"""

    # Step 1: Create project
    project = test_client.post("/api/v1/projects", json={"name": "Q1 Planning"})
    project_id = project.json()["id"]

    # Step 2: Upload meeting
    meeting = test_client.post("/api/v1/meetings", json={
        "project_id": project_id,
        "transcript": "Meeting about Q1 goals...",
        "date": "2024-01-15"
    })
    assert meeting.status_code == 201

    # Step 3: Get summary
    summary = test_client.get(f"/api/v1/meetings/{meeting.json()['id']}/summary")
    assert summary.status_code == 200
    assert len(summary.json()["action_items"]) > 0

    # Step 4: Search insights
    search = test_client.post("/api/v1/search", json={
        "query": "What are the Q1 goals?",
        "project_id": project_id
    })
    assert search.status_code == 200
    assert len(search.json()["results"]) > 0

    # Step 5: Generate weekly report
    report = test_client.post("/api/v1/reports/weekly", json={
        "project_id": project_id,
        "week_start": "2024-01-15"
    })
