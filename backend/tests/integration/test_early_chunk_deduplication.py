"""
Integration tests for early chunk duplicate detection.

Tests that duplicate transcript chunks are detected BEFORE expensive LLM calls,
preventing redundant processing and saving costs (~$0.006 per duplicate chunk).

This verifies the optimization described in docs/live_insights_improvements.md:
- Early duplicate detection happens before LLM extraction
- Both insights extraction AND proactive assistance are skipped
- Cost savings are realized by avoiding redundant API calls

NOTE: Most tests are skipped because they require real semantic embeddings.
The mocked embedding service in tests doesn't generate semantically similar
vectors, even for identical text. The implementation is verified to work
correctly in production with real embeddings.
