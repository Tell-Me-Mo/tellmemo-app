Meeting: Weekly Product Standup
Date: January 15, 2024
Attendees: John Doe (PM), Jane Smith (Dev Lead), Bob Johnson (Designer)

Agenda:
1. Sprint Progress Review
2. API Authentication Discussion
3. UI/UX Updates
4. Blockers and Next Steps

Discussion:

Sprint Progress:
John opened the meeting by reviewing the current sprint progress. The team has completed 60% of the planned stories, with the core features on track for the deadline. Jane mentioned that the backend infrastructure is stable and ready for integration testing.

API Authentication:
The team had an extensive discussion about API authentication methods. After evaluating several options including OAuth2, API keys, and JWT tokens, the team decided to implement JWT tokens for API authentication. This decision was based on better security, scalability, and the ability to include user claims in the token. Jane will lead the implementation, with a target completion date of January 22.

UI/UX Updates:
Bob presented the latest mockups for the dashboard redesign. The new design features improved data visualization, better mobile responsiveness, and adheres to the Material Design 3 guidelines. The team agreed that the new design significantly improves user experience.

Blockers:
- Waiting for design assets from the marketing team (expected by Jan 17)
- Need clarification on payment integration requirements from the product team
- Database migration scripts need review before deployment

Action Items:
1. Jane: Implement JWT authentication by Jan 22
2. Bob: Finalize dashboard designs and create design specs by Jan 18
3. John: Schedule meeting with payment team for requirements clarification
4. Team: Review database migration scripts by Jan 19

Next Steps:
- Continue with sprint development
- Daily standups at 9 AM
- Code review session on Thursday
- Sprint demo on Friday at 2 PM

Meeting adjourned at 10:45 AM.
