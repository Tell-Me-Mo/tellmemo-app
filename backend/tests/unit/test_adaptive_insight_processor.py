"""
Unit tests for AdaptiveInsightProcessor - Priority Context Mapping

Tests the PRIORITY_CONTEXT_MAP functionality to ensure:
1. IMMEDIATE priority chunks are processed instantly (0 context needed)
2. HIGH priority chunks wait for 2 chunks of context
3. MEDIUM priority chunks accumulate 3 chunks
4. LOW priority chunks batch 4 chunks
5. MAX_BATCH_SIZE forces processing at 5 chunks regardless of priority
