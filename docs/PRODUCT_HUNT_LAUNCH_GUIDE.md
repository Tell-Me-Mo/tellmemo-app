# TellMeMo Product Hunt Launch Guide

**Document Status:** Ready for Launch - October 2025
**Last Updated:** October 31, 2025
**MAJOR UPDATE:** Live Meeting Intelligence feature added - revolutionary differentiator

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE: Your Positioning Has Changed

**OLD POSITIONING (Pre-Oct 31):**
- "Open source meeting notes"
- "Search across 1,000+ meetings"
- Focus on post-meeting search and summaries

**NEW POSITIONING (Post-Live Intelligence Feature):**
- **"Get answers DURING meetings. No more 'let me get back to you'"**
- **Real-time question detection + instant answers (<2 seconds)**
- **ONLY tool that does this - nobody else has live meeting intelligence**

### Why This Changes Everything

Every competitor (Otter, Fireflies, Meeting.ai, Lyra, Granola, Bluedot) does the same thing:
1. Record meeting
2. Transcribe AFTER meeting ends
3. Let you search later

TellMeMo now does something nobody else does:
1. Listen to meeting IN REAL-TIME
2. Detect questions AS THEY'RE SPOKEN
3. Find answers DURING the meeting (<2 seconds)
4. Meeting continues naturally - no interruptions

This is not an incremental improvement. This is a category-defining feature.

### Your Product Hunt Launch MUST Lead With This

❌ **DON'T** lead with "open source" or "project intelligence"
✅ **DO** lead with "Stop saying 'let me get back to you'"

❌ **DON'T** show post-meeting search as hero feature
✅ **DO** show real-time question detection as #1 gallery item

❌ **DON'T** compare features with competitors
✅ **DO** emphasize "DURING meetings" vs "AFTER meetings"

**Your tagline MUST communicate this immediately. Recommended:**
"Get answers DURING meetings. No more 'let me get back'"

---

## 🎯 Recommended Launch Tags (Select 3)

### Primary Recommendation:
1. **Artificial Intelligence** - Core feature, high-traffic category
2. **Productivity** - Primary use case, broad appeal
3. **Open Source** - Unique differentiator, community appeal

### Alternative Options:
- **Project Management** - If targeting PM-specific audience
- **Meetings** - Direct category match, but more competitive
- **Developer Tools** - If emphasizing technical/self-hosting aspects

**Why This Combination Wins:**
- AI + Productivity = High search volume and relevance
- Open Source = Unique in the meeting notes space, attracts tech community
- Covers both the "what" (AI productivity) and "how" (open source)

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL 2025 UPDATE

**The game has changed:** Product Hunt now manually curates which products get "featured" on the homepage. Without being featured, you get ZERO visibility, regardless of upvotes.

**What this means:**
- Upvotes alone don't guarantee success
- Product Hunt team decides if you make the homepage
- Quality over quantity matters more than ever
- You need a compelling story, not just a good product

---

## 📊 Competitive Landscape Analysis

**Recent AI Meeting Tools on Product Hunt (2025):**

| Product | Tagline | Result | Key Differentiator |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| **Meeting.ai** | "An AI notetaker built for visual learners" | 312 upvotes | Visual summaries + hand-drawn diagrams |
| **Lyra** | "Record, transcribe + auto-create action items for every call" | Recent launch | Live task creation during meetings |
| **Granola** | "AI meeting notes without bots" | Product of the Day (Oct 3) | No bot joining meetings |
| **Bluedot** | "Record Google Meet calls without bots" | #3 Product of the Week | Bot-free recording |

**Key Insight:** "Without bots" is a major trend. Products emphasizing privacy/non-intrusive recording are winning.

**Your Competitive Advantage:**
1. ✅ **LIVE MEETING INTELLIGENCE** (NOBODY else does real-time question detection + answers DURING meetings)
2. ✅ **Open source** (nobody else offers this)
3. ✅ **4-tier answer discovery** (RAG → Meeting Context → Live Monitoring → AI Fallback)
4. ✅ **Self-hosting option** (data ownership)
5. ✅ **10x cheaper than competitors** ($1/hour vs Otter's $10/hour)
6. ✅ **Project hierarchy** (Portfolio/Program/Project - unique)
7. ✅ **Cross-project search** (search 1,000+ meetings)

**TellMeMo First Comment (Copy-Paste Ready):**

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Nick, founder of TellMeMo. We're launching today with something I've never seen before in meeting tools.

🎯 THE MOMENT EVERYTHING CHANGED

Last Tuesday, someone asked "What's the deployment timeline?" in our sprint planning.

Before I could say "let me find that doc," the answer was already on screen. From the tech spec. Page 12. Exact quote. With a link.

Nobody searched. Nobody interrupted. The meeting just... continued.

I've been saying "let me get back to you" for 10 years in project management. That moment made me realize: we don't have to anymore.

❌ THE PROBLEM WE ALL HAVE

You're in a meeting. Someone asks a question. Three terrible options:
1. Say "let me get back to you" → Question gets forgotten
2. Search while everyone waits → 3 minutes of awkward silence
3. Answer from memory → 50/50 chance you're wrong

All three options suck. So meetings become longer, less productive, and nobody gets clear answers.

⚡ WHAT MAKES TELLMEMO DIFFERENT

**We answer questions DURING meetings. Not after.**

Here's what happens when someone asks "What's the API rate limit?":
- AI detects the question AS YOU SPEAK
- Searches your docs in 2 seconds
- Answer appears on screen with source
- Meeting continues naturally

**Four-tier answer discovery:**
1. 📚 **Your Documents** (2 sec) - Searches all uploaded content
2. 💬 **Earlier in Meeting** (0.5 sec) - Checks if already answered
3. 👂 **Live Monitoring** (15 sec) - Waits to see if someone answers naturally
4. 🤖 **AI Fallback** (3 sec) - Generates answer with "verify this" warning

Every answer shows its source. "From Q3_Planning.pdf, page 12." Click to verify. No black boxes.

✨ WHAT ELSE IT DOES

🎯 **Automatic Action Tracking** → AI detects "Sarah, send that by Friday" and captures it with owner + deadline
🔍 **Cross-Project Search** → Ask questions across 1,000+ meetings
📊 **Portfolio Intelligence** → Organize by Portfolio → Program → Project
📝 **Smart Summaries** → Executive, technical, or stakeholder formats
🔓 **100% Open Source** → Self-host with Docker or use our cloud

📊 BETA RESULTS (50+ Real Meetings)

- 90%+ question answer rate across all tiers
- 30% reduction in average meeting length
- Zero "let me get back to you" moments
- 85% of users said they'd pay for this

🆚 HOW WE'RE DIFFERENT FROM OTTER/FIREFLIES

❌ Competitors: Record meetings, transcribe AFTER, search later
✅ TellMeMo: Detect questions DURING meetings, answer in real-time

❌ Competitors: $10-20/user/month = $10/hour for 10 users
✅ TellMeMo: ~$1/hour (you control API keys) = 10x cheaper

❌ Competitors: Proprietary, cloud-only
✅ TellMeMo: 100% open source, self-host option

We're the ONLY tool that answers questions in real-time during live meetings.

## 🎯 Distribution Channels (Launch Day)

### Primary (High ROI):
1. **Twitter**
   - Personal account + company account
   - Tag @ProductHunt in posts
   - Use hashtags: #ProductHunt #AI #Productivity #OpenSource
   - Post 5-8 times throughout the day (different angles)

2. **Email**
   - Existing users (if any)
   - Newsletter subscribers
   - Warm leads from sales pipeline
   - Template: "We're live on Product Hunt - your feedback would mean everything"

3. **Direct Outreach**
   - Message people who supported previous launches
   - Reach out to makers of complementary tools
   - Ask investors/advisors for support
   - Ping friends in relevant industries (PMs, consultants)

### Secondary (Medium ROI):
4. **LinkedIn**
   - Personal post about the journey
   - Share in relevant groups (project management, productivity)
   - Tag team members to amplify

5. **Reddit**
   - r/ProductHunt, r/SideProject, r/entrepreneur
   - Provide value first ("I built X, here's what I learned")
   - Don't just drop links

6. **Slack/Discord Communities**
   - Ask community admins for permission first
   - Frame as "seeking feedback" not "asking for upvotes"
   - Engage in conversation, don't spam

### Tertiary (Low ROI but do anyway):
7. **IndieHackers**
   - Share your launch story
   - Focus on open source angle

8. **Hacker News**
   - Post as "Show HN: TellMeMo - Open Source Meeting Intelligence"
   - HN audience loves open source

9. **Dev.to / Hashnode**
   - Write a technical post about building it
   - Link to PH launch at end

---

## 🎯 Engagement Strategy

### What You CAN Do:
✅ Share your launch link everywhere
✅ Ask people to "check it out and share feedback"
✅ Ask for comments (comments boost rankings)
✅ Reply to every single comment
✅ Upvote other products
✅ Offer exclusive deals to PH users

### What You CANNOT Do:
❌ Ask directly for upvotes (violates PH rules)
❌ Use bots or fake accounts
❌ Buy upvotes (they track this)
❌ Spam communities with just your link

**The Workaround:**
Instead of "Please upvote us," say:
- "We're launching on Product Hunt today - would love your honest feedback!"
- "Check out what we built and let me know what you think"
- "If you find this useful, sharing with your network would mean the world"

---

## 💬 Comment Response Templates

### When someone asks about pricing:
```
Great question! TellMeMo is 100% open source and free. You can:
- Self-host with Docker (completely free forever)
- Use our cloud version (free tier available)

For cloud power users, we have paid plans starting at [price] with [features].

What's your use case? Happy to recommend the best option for you!
```

### When someone compares to Otter/Fireflies:
```
Good question! Here's how we're different:

Otter/Fireflies → Individual meeting focus
TellMeMo → Project intelligence across ALL meetings

Think of it like:
- Otter = Google search for ONE document
- TellMeMo = Google search for your ENTIRE project history

Also, we're open source + you can self-host. Your data stays yours. 🔓

Does that make sense? What would you use it for?
```

### When someone is confused about value prop:
```
Let me give you a real example:

Yesterday, a PM asked "Why did we decide to use REST instead of GraphQL?"

With traditional tools:
- Search Notion (not there)
- Check Slack (can't find it)
- Ask the team (nobody remembers)
- Manually scrub through 20 meeting recordings ❌

With TellMeMo:
- Ask "Why did we choose REST over GraphQL?"
- Get answer in 3 seconds with exact source citation ✅

It's like having a photographic memory of every project decision.

Does that help? What's your biggest pain point with meeting notes?
```

### When someone has a concern:
```
That's a super valid concern! Here's how we handle that:

[Address concern specifically]

[Ask follow-up]: Is there anything else we should consider?

We're still early and building in the open - your feedback helps us build the right thing. 🙏
```

### When someone loves it:
```
Thank you so much! 🙏 That means a lot.

[Ask]: What feature are you most excited about?
[Invite]: We're offering [launch special] to first 100 PH users - would you like early access?

And if you know any [target persona], sharing with them would be amazing. Thanks again!
```

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Launching without audience** → Build for 30 days first
2. **Generic tagline** → Be specific about what you do
3. **No first comment** → 70% of winners post first
4. **Not replying to comments** → Reply within 9 minutes
5. **Asking for upvotes directly** → Violates PH rules
6. **Launching on Friday** → Less traffic on weekends
7. **Bad thumbnail** → Most people never click
8. **No special offer** → Give PH community exclusive value
9. **Ignoring other launches** → Reciprocity matters
10. **Giving up after 6 hours** → Stay engaged all 24 hours

## 🎯 Top 5 Recommendations for TellMeMo

1. **LEAD WITH LIVE MEETING INTELLIGENCE - NOT "OPEN SOURCE"** - This is your ONLY truly unique feature. Tagline MUST be: "Get answers DURING meetings. No more 'let me get back'" - This is what NO competitor does. Open source is secondary positioning.

2. **Make a 30-second hero video showing REAL-TIME question detection** - Show someone asking "What's the deployment date?" in a LIVE meeting → Answer appears in 2 seconds from a PDF → Meeting continues. This ONE feature is your entire differentiation. If people don't understand this is real-time DURING meetings (not after), you've lost.

3. **Emphasize "DURING meetings" vs "AFTER meetings" everywhere** - Otter/Fireflies transcribe AFTER. You answer DURING. This must be crystal clear in every piece of copy. Use comparison: "❌ Competitors: Search after meetings. ✅ TellMeMo: Answers during meetings."

4. **Show concrete metrics in first 3 sentences** - "90% answer rate. 30% shorter meetings. <2 seconds per answer." Numbers make it real and credible. Beta results prove this works.

5. **Target PH on Tuesday or Wednesday** - Highest traffic, and you have the strongest positioning in meeting intelligence space right now. Avoid Friday-Monday. Build for 30 days before launch (engage daily).
