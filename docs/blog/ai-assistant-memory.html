                    "Why did we choose Postgres over MongoDB?" New engineer, reasonable question. I had no idea. The AI did. Complete with who suggested it, when, and the exact reasoning.
                </p>

                <h2>The Question</h2>
                <p>
                    It was a simple onboarding question. Our new backend engineer wanted to understand our tech decisions. Specifically, why we went with Postgres when MongoDB seemed like a better fit for our document-heavy data model.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was the tech lead. I should know this. I was probably in the meeting where we decided. But this was six months ago, and I had attended approximately 200 meetings since then.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My brain: blank.
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>ü§î The Reality</h3>
                    <p>You attend 20-30 meetings per week. That's 500-800 meetings per year. Nobody's brain was designed to retain all that.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Search</h2>
                <p>
                    Old me would have spent 20 minutes hunting through:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Email threads</li>
                    <li>Slack messages</li>
                    <li>Architecture decision records (if we'd written any)</li>
                    <li>Meeting notes (if I'd taken any)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Instead, I typed into TellMeMo: "Why did we choose Postgres over MongoDB?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    15 seconds later, I had the answer.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "Discussion from Architecture Review, March 15, 2025:
                    <br><br>
                    Dave (CTO): 'MongoDB would work, but we're likely to need complex joins as we grow. Postgres gives us flexibility to go relational if needed.'
                    <br><br>
                    Sarah (Backend Lead): 'Plus our team knows Postgres better. Learning curve matters.'
                    <br><br>
                    Decision: Postgres. Rationale: Team expertise + future flexibility > current data model fit."
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Beyond Simple Recall</h2>
                <p>
                    What's wild isn't just that the AI remembered‚Äîit's that it understood context. It connected Dave's comment about joins to Sarah's point about team expertise and synthesized the actual reasoning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My notes from that meeting (if I'd taken any) would have said: "Decision: Postgres." The AI captured the why, not just the what.
                </p>

                <h2>The Institutional Memory Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    Every company has this problem. Knowledge lives in people's heads. When they leave, it leaves. When they forget, it's gone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We try to solve it with documentation. But documentation requires:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Someone to write it (they won't)</li>
                    <li>Someone to maintain it (they definitely won't)</li>
                    <li>Everyone to read it (haha)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    AI changes this. It automatically captures every discussion, extracts the decisions, and makes them searchable. No extra work. No documentation debt.
                </p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>üìö What We've Captured</h3>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ 847 technical decisions</p>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ 1,200+ client conversations</p>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ 3,500+ action items</p>
                    <p>‚Ä¢ All searchable in seconds</p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Unexpected Uses</h2>
                <p>
                    Once you have institutional memory as a searchable database, you start using it for everything:
                </p>

                <h3>Onboarding</h3>
                <p>
                    "What's our philosophy on microservices?" Ask the AI. Get 6 months of relevant discussions, condensed.
                </p>

                <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
                <p>
                    "I thought we agreed to ship this feature in Q2?" Search for it. Find out it was Q3, and who said it.
                </p>

                <h3>Pattern Recognition</h3>
                <p>
                    "How many times have we discussed rewriting the frontend?" AI shows you: 7 times. Maybe stop discussing and start doing.
                </p>

                <h3>Learning from Mistakes</h3>
                <p>
                    "Why did the last migration fail?" AI surfaces the post-mortem discussion, the lessons learned, and the preventive measures we agreed on.
                </p>

                <h2>The Philosophical Shift</h2>
                <p>
                    There's something profound about having perfect organizational memory. It changes how you think about meetings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You stop trying to remember everything. You participate instead of documenting. You trust that important information will be captured and findable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's liberating.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    "I used to stress about taking detailed notes. Now I just engage in the conversation. The AI handles the rest."
                    <br><br>‚Äî Product Manager, our team
                </blockquote>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>
                    Your AI assistant knows more than you do. Not because it's smarter‚Äîbecause it has perfect recall and infinite patience for searching through historical context.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That's not threatening. That's exactly what you want. Let the AI remember. You focus on thinking.
                </p>
