Duration: 55 minutes
Attendees: Jennifer Martinez (Marketing Director), Alex Thompson (Product Manager), Samantha Lee (Social Media Manager), Robert Chen (Sales Director), Michelle Adams (Brand Strategist), Tom Baker (Creative Director)

================================================================================

[00:00] Jennifer Martinez:
Good morning team. Thanks for making time for this strategy session. We're eight weeks out from the EcoBottle launch on March 20th and we need to finalize our go-to-market strategy. Alex, can you start by recapping the product for everyone?

[00:25] Alex Thompson:
Sure. EcoBottle is our new smart water bottle with temperature control and hydration tracking. It syncs with a mobile app to remind users to drink water and tracks their daily intake. The bottle keeps beverages cold for 24 hours or hot for 12 hours. Retail price is 89 dollars, positioning us in the premium segment.

[00:55] Alex Thompson:
What makes it unique is the UV-C self-cleaning technology. Users press a button and UV light sterilizes the interior in 60 seconds. This addresses the biggest complaint about reusable bottles - they get gross and smelly over time.

[01:20] Jennifer Martinez:
Perfect summary. That UV-C cleaning feature is our hero differentiator. Michelle, what's your take on the brand positioning?

[01:35] Michelle Adams:
We're positioning EcoBottle at the intersection of wellness, sustainability, and technology. Our target customer is health-conscious millennials and Gen Z who are willing to pay premium prices for products that align with their values.

[02:00] Michelle Adams:
The brand voice is aspirational but approachable. We're not preachy about sustainability - we're making it easy and desirable. The tagline we're testing is "Hydration. Elevated." Short, memorable, and hints at the premium positioning.

[02:25] Tom Baker:
I love "Hydration. Elevated." It works visually too. We can play with elevation in the creative - showing the bottle on pedestals, in high-end environments, paired with premium lifestyle imagery.

[02:45] Jennifer Martinez:
Great. Let's talk campaign architecture. Samantha, walk us through the social media strategy.

[03:00] Samantha Lee:
We're building a three-phase campaign. Phase one is teaser content starting February 1st. We're not showing the product yet, just creating curiosity. Think mysterious posts about "something revolutionary" and "the future of hydration."

[03:25] Samantha Lee:
Phase two starts February 15th with the product reveal. We announce EcoBottle with a hero video showing all the key features. This is when we launch our influencer partnerships and start taking pre-orders.

[03:45] Samantha Lee:
Phase three is launch week, March 20th through 26th. Heavy push across all channels, user-generated content campaign, and our biggest influencer activations.

[04:05] Jennifer Martinez:
What's the budget allocation across those phases?

[04:15] Samantha Lee:
We have 300,000 dollars total for paid social. I'm recommending 50,000 for phase one, 100,000 for phase two, and 150,000 for phase three. We want maximum impact during launch week.

[04:35] Robert Chen:
Question on phase two. You mentioned pre-orders starting February 15th. What's our sales target for the pre-order period?

[04:50] Alex Thompson:
We're targeting 5,000 pre-orders by launch day. That generates 445,000 dollars in revenue before we even officially launch. It also validates demand and helps us forecast inventory needs.

[05:10] Robert Chen:
5,000 is ambitious but achievable. We need to make the pre-order offer compelling. Are we doing any early-bird discounts or bonuses?

[05:25] Jennifer Martinez:
Good question. What's everyone's thoughts on discounting?

[05:35] Michelle Adams:
I'd advise against discounting this early. It undermines the premium positioning. Instead, let's offer added value. Maybe a free carrying case or an extended warranty for pre-orders?

[05:55] Alex Thompson:
The carrying case costs us 8 dollars to manufacture. If we give it free to pre-orders, that's a 40,000 dollar investment for 5,000 units. But it protects the 89 dollar price point.

[06:15] Robert Chen:
I support that approach. Discounting trains customers to wait for sales. The carrying case is a tangible bonus that doesn't devalue the product.

[06:30] Jennifer Martinez:
Agreed. Alex, work with the manufacturing team to produce 5,000 carrying cases for the pre-order campaign. Samantha, make sure the free carrying case is prominently featured in all pre-order messaging.

[06:50] Samantha Lee:
Will do. One more thing on pre-orders - should we create urgency with a limited quantity?

[07:00] Samantha Lee:
Like, "only 5,000 pre-order slots available." Even if we could technically take more orders, scarcity drives action.

[07:15] Michelle Adams:
I like that. Scarcity is a powerful motivator. But we need to be honest - if we say 5,000 and we sell out, we can't suddenly have more pre-order slots. That damages trust.

[07:35] Alex Thompson:
From a supply chain perspective, 5,000 is actually a realistic cap for our first production run. We could do more, but it would delay fulfillment. So the scarcity is real, not manufactured.

[07:55] Jennifer Martinez:
Perfect. So we commit to 5,000 pre-orders maximum, and we communicate that clearly. "First 5,000 customers get free carrying case and guaranteed delivery by March 25th."

[08:15] Tom Baker:
Can we add a countdown timer on the website? Shows how many pre-order slots remain. Creates real-time urgency.

[08:25] Samantha Lee:
Love that. I'll work with the web team to implement it.

[08:35] Jennifer Martinez:
Excellent. Let's shift to influencer strategy. Samantha, who are we partnering with?

[08:50] Samantha Lee:
We're targeting three tiers of influencers. Tier one is mega-influencers with over 1 million followers. We're in talks with Casey Neistat and Emma Chamberlain. Both have wellness and sustainability credibility.

[09:15] Samantha Lee:
Tier two is micro-influencers with 50,000 to 200,000 followers in the fitness, wellness, and eco-lifestyle spaces. We're sending free products to about 50 influencers in this tier.

[09:35] Samantha Lee:
Tier three is nano-influencers and brand ambassadors with 5,000 to 50,000 followers. We're creating an ambassador program where they get a custom discount code and earn commission on sales.

[09:55] Robert Chen:
What kind of engagement are we expecting from the mega-influencers? And what's the cost?

[10:10] Samantha Lee:
Casey Neistat is asking for 75,000 dollars for a dedicated YouTube video and three Instagram stories. Emma Chamberlain is 60,000 for an Instagram post and stories. Both will create authentic content, not obviously scripted ads.

[10:35] Jennifer Martinez:
That's 135,000 of our total marketing budget. Is that worth it?

[10:45] Samantha Lee:
Casey's average YouTube video gets 2 million views. Emma's Instagram posts get 500,000 to 1 million likes. The reach is massive, and their audiences are perfectly aligned with our target demographic.

[11:05] Michelle Adams:
I think it's worth it, but we need to negotiate creative control. We should approve the content before it goes live to ensure it hits our key messaging points.

[11:20] Samantha Lee:
I've already discussed that with their teams. They're open to brand guidelines and key talking points, but they want creative freedom to make it feel authentic to their style. That's non-negotiable for them.

[11:40] Tom Baker:
Honestly, we should trust them. They know their audiences better than we do. As long as they hit the UV-C cleaning feature and the app integration, let them tell the story their way.

[12:00] Jennifer Martinez:
I agree. Authenticity is more valuable than perfect messaging. Samantha, move forward with both Casey and Emma. Get contracts signed by end of this week.

[12:15] Samantha Lee:
On it.

[12:20] Jennifer Martinez:
Robert, let's talk retail strategy. Where are we selling EcoBottle?

[12:35] Robert Chen:
We're launching direct-to-consumer through our website first. That's where the pre-orders happen and where we have the highest margins. In April, we're rolling out to REI and Whole Foods for retail distribution.

[12:55] Robert Chen:
REI is a perfect fit - outdoor enthusiasts who value sustainability. Whole Foods gives us placement in their wellness section alongside premium health products. Both retailers have committed to prominent in-store displays.

[13:20] Alex Thompson:
What about Amazon? I know we discussed it but I don't remember the decision.

[13:30] Robert Chen:
We're holding off on Amazon until Q3. We want to build brand equity and premium perception before we go to a price-competitive marketplace. Amazon customers are trained to look for the lowest price and we can't compete with knockoffs at that level.

[13:55] Jennifer Martinez:
Smart approach. Build the brand story first, then expand distribution. What about international markets?

[14:10] Robert Chen:
Phase one is US only. If we hit our targets, we'll explore Canada and UK in Q4. But let's walk before we run.

[14:25] Jennifer Martinez:
Agreed. Tom, let's talk creative assets. What do you have in production?

[14:40] Tom Baker:
We're creating a suite of assets for different channels. Hero product video is 90 seconds, showcases all features with lifestyle footage. We shot in Joshua Tree National Park to emphasize the outdoor sustainability angle.

[15:00] Tom Baker:
For social, we have 15-second cutdowns optimized for Instagram Reels and TikTok. Fast-paced, music-driven, designed for short attention spans. We're also creating static images for ads - product on clean white backgrounds and lifestyle contexts.

[15:25] Tom Baker:
Email campaign has a different tone - more informational, detailed feature callouts. We're A/B testing two subject lines: "Meet Your New Hydration Companion" versus "The Water Bottle That Cleans Itself."

[15:50] Michelle Adams:
I like the second subject line better. It leads with the most unique feature. The self-cleaning aspect is what stops the scroll.

[16:05] Jennifer Martinez:
I agree. Tom, make the self-cleaning subject line the primary test. What's the timeline for creative delivery?

[16:20] Tom Baker:
Hero video will be ready by February 1st for the teaser phase. Social cutdowns and static images by February 10th. Email templates by February 12th. We're on schedule.

[16:40] Jennifer Martinez:
Excellent. Let's talk PR strategy. Michelle, are we doing any press outreach?

[16:55] Michelle Adams:
Yes, we're targeting tech and lifestyle publications. TechCrunch, The Verge, Wired for the tech angle. Well+Good, Goop, Men's Health for the wellness angle. We're pitching the story as "the intersection of health tech and sustainability."

[17:20] Michelle Adams:
We're also trying to get product placements on morning shows. Good Morning America, Today Show. A segment on "innovative wellness products" would be huge exposure.

[17:40] Jennifer Martinez:
Have you made any progress with the morning shows?

[17:50] Michelle Adams:
We have a contact at GMA who's interested. They're considering it for their "Deals and Steals" segment in early March. Only challenge is they want a special price for their audience.

[18:10] Jennifer Martinez:
We just said no discounting. What kind of price are they asking for?

[18:20] Michelle Adams:
They want us at 69 dollars instead of 89. But the exposure is worth millions in advertising value. GMA reaches 3 to 4 million viewers.

[18:40] Robert Chen:
I'm conflicted. The exposure is incredible but 69 dollars sets a price anchor that could hurt our regular sales. People will wait for sales if they know we discount.

[19:00] Alex Thompson:
What if we frame it differently? Not a discount, but a limited GMA exclusive bundle. 89 dollar bottle plus the carrying case which we're valuing at 20 dollars. So it's technically a 109 dollar value for 89 dollars.

[19:25] Michelle Adams:
That's clever. We're not discounting the product, we're adding value. And it aligns with our pre-order strategy of giving away the carrying case.

[19:40] Jennifer Martinez:
I like that solution. Michelle, pitch that to GMA and see if they'll accept it. We hold at 89 dollars but throw in extras.

[19:55] Michelle Adams:
Will do. I'll follow up with them this week.

[20:05] Jennifer Martinez:
Okay, let's talk launch event. Are we doing anything special for March 20th?

[20:20] Tom Baker:
I've been thinking about a virtual launch event. A livestream on Instagram and YouTube with product demos, Q&A, maybe some celebrity guests. We could do giveaways during the stream to drive engagement.

[20:45] Samantha Lee:
I love that idea. We could get Casey or Emma to co-host if their contracts include it. Make it feel like a big deal, like an Apple product launch but for water bottles.

[21:00] Alex Thompson:
What about an in-person event? Pop-up in New York or LA with product demos, free samples, Instagram-worthy installations?

[21:20] Jennifer Martinez:
Budget for in-person event?

[21:25] Tom Baker:
Venue rental, staffing, installations, catering - we're looking at 50,000 to 75,000 for a quality pop-up in a major city.

[21:40] Jennifer Martinez:
That's steep. What's the ROI compared to putting that money into paid ads?

[21:55] Michelle Adams:
Pop-ups generate content and PR value that's hard to quantify. Local news coverage, influencer content from the event, user-generated content. It's not just about direct sales at the event.

[22:15] Robert Chen:
Can we do both? Smaller budget for a one-day pop-up, maybe 25,000 dollars, plus a virtual livestream event that's the main focus?

[22:30] Jennifer Martinez:
That's a good compromise. Tom, scope out a one-day pop-up in LA. Samantha, own the virtual livestream. Let's make March 20th feel like a major moment.

[22:50] Tom Baker:
On it. I'll send venue options by next week.

[23:00] Samantha Lee:
I'll create a runsheet for the livestream and identify potential co-hosts.

[23:10] Jennifer Martinez:
Great. Let's talk metrics and KPIs. How are we measuring success for this campaign?

[23:25] Robert Chen:
Primary metric is units sold. We're targeting 10,000 units in the first month, which is 890,000 dollars in revenue. That covers our marketing spend and then some.

[23:45] Samantha Lee:
For social, I'm tracking engagement rate, follower growth, and earned media value. We want to grow our Instagram following by 25,000 during the campaign and achieve at least 5 percent engagement rate.

[24:05] Michelle Adams:
Brand awareness is another key metric. We're running pre and post-launch surveys to measure unaided brand recall. Our goal is 15 percent unaided recall in our target demographic by end of Q1.

[24:25] Jennifer Martinez:
Those are good metrics. What about customer acquisition cost?

[24:35] Samantha Lee:
With 300,000 in paid social spend, if we hit 10,000 units sold, our CAC is 30 dollars. That's healthy for an 89 dollar product.

[24:50] Robert Chen:
And that's just first purchase. If we can get repeat purchases and build a subscription model for replacement filters or accessories, the lifetime value goes way up.

[25:10] Alex Thompson:
Speaking of accessories, are we launching anything alongside the bottle?

[25:20] Robert Chen:
We have the carrying case which we're giving away with pre-orders. We're also developing a cleaning tablet subscription - monthly delivery of UV-enhancement tablets that boost the self-cleaning effectiveness. That launches in Q2.

[25:45] Jennifer Martinez:
Subscription revenue is a great long-term play. Okay, we're running low on time. Any risks or concerns we haven't addressed?

[26:00] Alex Thompson:
My biggest concern is inventory. If we sell out in week one, that's great for scarcity but terrible for capturing demand. We can't scale production fast enough to restock quickly.

[26:20] Robert Chen:
I've been working with manufacturing on this. We have 15,000 units in the first production run. If we hit our 10,000 unit target in month one, we have a 5,000 unit buffer. That should carry us through a surge.

[26:45] Alex Thompson:
What if we do better than expected and sell 15,000 in the first month?

[26:55] Robert Chen:
Then we have a happy problem. We take backorders and communicate a 2-3 week lead time for the next batch. Scarcity actually works in our favor for a premium product.

[27:15] Michelle Adams:
I agree. Being sold out is a better story than having excess inventory. It signals demand and desirability.

[27:30] Jennifer Martinez:
Any other risks?

[27:35] Samantha Lee:
Influencer risk. If Casey or Emma's content underperforms or if they get embroiled in some controversy before posting, we're out 135,000 dollars with little to show for it.

[27:55] Jennifer Martinez:
That's a real risk. Can we build in performance clauses? If the content doesn't hit certain view or engagement thresholds, they don't get full payment?

[28:10] Samantha Lee:
I can try to negotiate that, but mega-influencers usually don't agree to performance-based payment. Their fee is for the content creation and posting, not for guaranteed results.

[28:30] Tom Baker:
We should have backup plans. If influencer content doesn't perform, we can pivot budget to paid ads or other channels. We're not putting all our eggs in the influencer basket.

[28:50] Jennifer Martinez:
Good point. Diversification protects us. What percentage of our budget is influencer versus paid ads versus other channels?

[29:05] Samantha Lee:
Influencers are 45 percent of budget, paid social ads are 40 percent, remaining 15 percent is split between email marketing, PR, and events.

[29:25] Jennifer Martinez:
That's fairly balanced. I'm comfortable with that split. Alright team, let's do a quick round-robin. Everyone share one thing they're committing to do this week.

[29:40] Alex Thompson:
I'm finalizing the pre-order landing page copy and coordinating with manufacturing on the 5,000 carrying cases.

[29:50] Samantha Lee:
I'm getting contracts signed with Casey and Emma and creating the content calendar for phase one teaser posts.

[30:00] Robert Chen:
I'm meeting with REI and Whole Foods buyers to confirm display locations and in-store marketing support.

[30:10] Michelle Adams:
I'm following up with GMA on the bundle proposal and sending press pitches to our target publications.

[30:20] Tom Baker:
I'm delivering the hero video for internal review and scouting LA venues for the pop-up event.

[30:30] Jennifer Martinez:
Perfect. I'm creating the master project timeline with all our deadlines and milestones, and presenting the campaign plan to the executive team for final approval.

[30:50] Jennifer Martinez:
One last thing - our next check-in is February 3rd, same time. By then, phase one teaser content should be live and we'll review early performance. Any questions?

[31:10] Tom Baker:
Are we sharing campaign details with the customer service team? They'll start getting questions once teaser content goes live.

[31:25] Jennifer Martinez:
Great point. I'll schedule a training session with customer service for next week. They need to know the product features and campaign messaging.

[31:40] Alex Thompson:
We should also create an FAQ document they can reference. "When does it launch? How much does it cost? What makes it different from other bottles?"

[31:55] Jennifer Martinez:
Yes, Alex, can you draft that FAQ? Share it with the team for review, then we'll distribute to customer service.

[32:10] Alex Thompson:
Will do.

[32:15] Jennifer Martinez:
Alright, anything else?

[32:20] Samantha Lee:
I'm good. Excited to get started.

[32:25] Robert Chen:
Same here. This is going to be a great launch.

[32:30] Michelle Adams:
Agreed. The product is solid and the campaign is creative. I'm confident we'll hit our targets.

[32:40] Tom Baker:
Let's make it happen. See you all next week.

[32:45] Jennifer Martinez:
Thanks everyone. Great work today. Let's execute flawlessly.

[32:50] Alex Thompson:
Talk soon.
