Hello everyone, thanks for joining today's infrastructure planning meeting. I wanted to start by asking - what's our current Q4 budget allocation for cloud infrastructure?

Good question. I believe Sarah sent those numbers in last week's email. Let me pull it up quickly.

I have it here. The Q4 cloud infrastructure budget is $250,000, which includes AWS costs, monitoring tools, and backup systems.

Perfect, thank you Sarah. That's very helpful. Now, regarding the migration timeline - John, can you take ownership of creating the detailed migration plan and have it ready by next Friday?

Absolutely, I'll get that migration plan drafted and circulated by end of week.

Great. One more thing - does anyone know what our average database response time was last quarter? I need that for the performance report.

I'm not sure off the top of my head. That might be in the monitoring dashboard docs. We should check the Datadog reports.

Okay, we'll follow up on that. Let's move to the next agenda item.
