[START RECORDING]

Hi everyone, thanks for joining today's sprint planning meeting. Let me share the agenda quickly.

First, we need to discuss the authentication module deadline. Sarah, you mentioned last week that the OAuth integration was at 70% completion. Can you give us an update on that? I'm wondering if we're still on track for the Friday deadline.

Actually, I just realized something. In our last meeting on October 15th, we decided to use JWT tokens for session management. But I heard from the backend team yesterday that they're now implementing OAuth2. That seems contradictory. We should clarify this before moving forward.

Okay, moving on. The payment gateway integration is critical. We absolutely must complete this by next Monday. This is a major risk if we don't deliver on time. The client specifically said this is their top priority, and any delay could jeopardize the entire project.

Now, about the testing strategy. We talked about this before. We discussed this last sprint too. And I think we covered it in the retrospective as well. We keep coming back to this same topic. Maybe we need to make a final decision today and move on.

Let me assign some action items. John, can you handle the API documentation? We need that completed. Also, someone needs to review the security audit report. And we should schedule a client demo. These are all important tasks that need owners.

One more thing - the database migration. Last month, we agreed to use PostgreSQL for production. But in yesterday's architecture meeting, someone mentioned using MongoDB. Wait, that doesn't make sense. We can't change the database at this stage. That conflicts with what we decided earlier.

I have a question about the deployment pipeline. Do we have monitoring set up? Are we tracking error rates? What about performance metrics? We need visibility into production health.

Also, there's some information missing here. We don't have the staging environment credentials. Nobody documented the API endpoints. And I don't see any information about backup procedures. These gaps need to be filled.

Let me make this clear - we will launch the beta version on November 1st. That's our firm deadline. Mark it on your calendars. We cannot miss this date.

Quick decision point: Should we use TypeScript or plain JavaScript for the new microservice? Let's decide now. I think TypeScript is better for maintainability. Everyone agree? Okay, settled - we're going with TypeScript.

Sarah raised a good point earlier about the OAuth situation. Based on our discussion from the October 10th technical review meeting, we actually standardized on OAuth2 with refresh tokens. The JWT approach was only for the internal admin panel. So there's no conflict - they're for different use cases.

One key insight here: The client wants real-time notifications. That's a crucial requirement we haven't addressed yet. Push notifications will be essential for user engagement.

Oh, and speaking of things we discussed before - remember the caching strategy discussion? We covered that in Q3 planning. It ties directly to what we're talking about now with performance.

Mike needs to complete the code review by Wednesday. Lisa, you're responsible for the load testing. Everyone should update their Jira tickets daily. These are clear action items with owners and deadlines.

There's a potential issue with the third-party API we're using. Their rate limits are lower than we expected. This could cause problems under high load. We need to evaluate alternatives or implement request queuing. This is a risk we need to mitigate.

What's our contingency plan if the deployment fails? Do we have rollback procedures documented? How long would downtime last? These are critical questions that need answers before we proceed.

To summarize the key points: OAuth2 for public API, JWT for admin panel. Launch date is November 1st. Mike handles code review, Lisa handles load testing. Database stays PostgreSQL - no changes. TypeScript for new microservices.

That's everything for today. Let's stay focused and hit our deadlines. Thanks everyone!
